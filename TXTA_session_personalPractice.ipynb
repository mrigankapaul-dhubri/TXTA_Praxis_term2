The messages will be \"unwrapped\" by sculptor Richard Wentworth, who is responsible for decorating the tree with broken plates and light bulbs. It is the 17th year that the gallery has invited an artist to dress their Christmas tree. Artists who have decorated the Tate tree in previous years include Tracey Emin in 2002.\\n\\nThe plain green Norway spruce is displayed in the gallery\\'s foyer. Its light bulb adornments are dimmed, ordinary domestic ones joined together with string. The plates decorating the branches will be auctioned off for the children\\'s charity ArtWorks. Wentworth worked as an assistant to sculptor Henry Moore in the late 1960s. His reputation as a sculptor grew in the 1980s, while he has been one of the most influential teachers during the last two decades. Wentworth is also known for his photography of mundane, everyday subjects such as a cigarette packet jammed under the wonky leg of a table.\\n',\n",

Other stars are expected to join the line-up in the coming months, and the Danish royal family will attend. \"Christian Andersen\\'s fairy tales are timeless and universal,\" said Jarre. \"For all of us, at any age there is always - beyond the pure enjoyment of the tale - a message to learn.\" There are year-long celebrations planned across the world to celebrate Andersen and his work, which includes The Emperor\\'s New Clothes and The Little Mermaid. Denmark\\'s Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary visited New York on Monday to help promote the festivities. The pair were at a Manhattan library to honour US literary critic Harold Bloom \"the international icon we thought we knew so well\".\\n\\n\"Bloom recognizes the darker aspects of Andersen\\'s authorship,\" Prince Frederik said. Bloom is to be formally presented with the Hans Christian Andersen Award this spring in Anderson\\'s hometown of Odense. The royal couple also visited the Hans Christian Anderson School complex, where Queen Mary read The Ugly Duckling to the young audience. Later at a gala dinner, Danish supermodel Helena Christensen was named a Hans Christian Andersen ambassador. Other ambassadors include actors Harvey Keitel and Sir Roger Moore, athlete Cathy Freeman and Brazilian soccer legend Pele.\\n',\n",

He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the \"very early stages\", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.\\n\\nA series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It\\'s a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern\\'s family in 1999, following Mr Brown\\'s success with Spend Spend Spend. He later secured the film rights from Paramount, enabling them to use the title It\\'s A Wonderful Life.\\n',\n",

The finalists for 2005 include Andrew Taylor\\'s The American Boy and Robbie Williams\\' autobiography Feel. This year\\'s winner, Alice Sebold\\'s The Lovely Bones, sold over one million. Joseph O\\'Connor\\'s Star of the Sea came second and saw sales increase by 350%. The best read award, on Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan\\'s Channel 4 show, is part of the British Book Awards. David Mitchell\\'s Booker-shortlisted novel, Cloud Atlas, makes it into this year\\'s top 10 along with several lesser known works.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no doubt that this year\\'s selection of book club entries is the best yet. If anything, the choice is even wider than last time,\" said Madeley. \"It was very hard to follow last year\\'s extremely successful list, but we think this year\\'s books will do even better,\" said Richard and Judy executive producer Amanda Ross. \"We were spoiled for choice and it was tough getting down to only 10 from the 301 submitted.\"\\n',\n",
              " \"Poppins musical gets flying start\\n\\nThe stage adaptation of children's film Mary Poppins has had its opening night in London's West End.\\n\\nSir Cameron Mackintosh's lavish production, which has cost £9m to bring to the stage, was given a 10-minute standing ovation. Lead actress Laura Michelle Kelly soared over the heads of the audience holding the nanny's trademark umbrella. Technical hitches had prevented Mary Poppins' flight into the auditorium during preview performances. A number of celebrities turned out for the musical's premiere, including actress Barbara Windsor, comic Graham Norton and Sir Richard Attenborough.\\n\\nThe show's director Richard Eyre issued a warning earlier in the week that the show was unsuitable for children under seven, while under-threes are barred. Mary Poppins was originally created by author Pamela Travers, who is said to have cried when she saw Disney's 1964 film starring Julie Andrews. Travers had intended the story to be a lot darker than the perennial family favourite. Theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh has said he hopes the musical is a blend of the sweet-natured film and the original book.\\n\"]"

He served as a pilot with the Royal Air Force during World War II, flying fighter planes to the Middle East. It was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay Flight into Danger. Hailey emigrated to Canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. He wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to Toronto.\\n\\n\"I fell to daydreaming. I visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. Could I fly the airplane? I was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn\\'t flown for nine years... \" Hailey later recalled. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation bought Flight into Danger for $600 (£318) and it was shown on TV in April 1956. It was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy Airplane!, starring Leslie Nielsen. Hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. He went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. Flight into Danger was adapted to become Hailey\\'s first novel, Runaway Zero-Eight in 1958. The Final Diagnosis and In High Places followed, both achieving a popular following. But it was not until Hotel, in 1965, that Hollywood came calling. The hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. It was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring James Brolin. Airport (1968) arguably remains Hailey\\'s best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. The thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.\\n\\nThe book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring Burt Lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and Dean Martin as a womanising pilot, alongside Jean Seberg and Jacqueline Bisset. In a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. The writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters \"from real life\" and taking up to three years to produce each book. \"I have never been able to write quickly or easily. I am too self-critical for that. I am never satisfied,\" he once said. In 1969, he moved to Nassau in the Bahamas, with his wife Sheila. Wheels (1971), The Moneychangers (1975) and Overload (1979) followed. Despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, Hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of Hollywood producers. Strong Medicine, Hailey\\'s blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring Sam Neill, Douglas Fairbanks Jr and a panoply of former soap stars. The 1997 novel Detective proved to be Hailey\\'s final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. Hailey\\'s health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. He suffered a stroke just two months ago. He died in his sleep on Wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in New Providence island. \"He had a wonderful life. His greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,\" said his wife, Sheila.\\n',\n",

When she was eight, her mother took a decision which changed her life. Fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs, she arranged for her to have ballet lessons. Very quickly it became apparent that she was something special. She was spotted by the Russian artistic impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, who wanted her to dance for his company, Ballets Russes.

              " 'Fears raised over ballet future\\n\\n\\n\\nNew research from the Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) has found fewer children over the age of 10 are attending ballet classes and taking exams in the discipline. The organisation blames the growing popularity of computer games and other changes in lifestyle. And there are fears that if the trend is not reversed, there could be fewer British ballet stars in the future. The RAD found that the number of youngsters taking their ballet exams drops by almost 70% after the age of 10 or 11. Dance teacher Eve Trew, who has taught ballet for over 48 years, told BBC News she had seen a \"vast\" change over the years. She blamed modern lifestyles for the fall in ballet attendance. \"I think the children of many years ago did not have as many hobbies,\" she said. \"The trouble now is that they are wide open to computers, Gameboys and everything else children have got. \"As a result, there is less time being spent on ballet lessons.\"\\n\\nHazel Gilbert, 23, an information manager from Newcastle, gave up ballet at the age of 10 and is typical of the problem. \"It\\'s not a very cool thing to do when you go to \\'big\\' school and I think you have to be very focused on ballet to want to carry on doing it,\" she said. \"I used to love it, but after a certain age it becomes much more disciplined and I didn\\'t want that. \"I started getting into other things, like swimming and kickboxing, and ballet just wasn\\'t something I wanted to do any more.\" Ms Trew, who runs a dance school in Gateshead, admitted it would be \"very difficult\" to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing to make the sacrifices to succeed. \"You have to be very dedicated and you have to be very disciplined. \"It is a career that you have got to really want to do because it is such hard work. \"Children these days have not got the time to spend perfecting it... that is very sad.\"\\n\\nCurrently, only two out of 16 principal dancers at the Royal Ballet - Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope - are British, compared to 16 of the 21 principals in 1985. But a spokesman for the English National Ballet told BBC News that although only two out of their 12 principal dancers were British, around a quarter of the company\\'s dancers were from the UK. He said competition at open auditions in London was \"fierce\" between talented dancers from all over the world. The RAD have launched a new competition to try and reverse the decline in British ballet. Dame Antoinette Sibley, president of the RAD, launched the Fonteyn Nureyev Young Dancers competition earlier this week.\\n\\nAimed at children aged 10 to 13, it is hoped the contest will help keep British ballet evolving. A spokeswoman for the RAD said: \"It is our responsibility to re-ignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the long-term future of ballet. \"We need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards, with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers. \"Perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience \\'performance\\' themselves. \"What better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance?\"\\n',\n",

Last year\\'s honorary winner, Stephen King, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone.\\n\\nThis year\\'s fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth\\'s The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women. One fiction judge, Stewart O\\'Nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said: \"I would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy.\" The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle\\'s for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family\\'s fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s.

              " 'Redford\\'s vision of Sundance\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s a rare downtown appearance for the man who started the annual festival in Park City, Utah back in the 1980s. Now in its twenty-first year, Sundance continues to grow. Some 45,000 people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind. It\\'s an opportunity to meet and make deals. Redford wanted Sundance to be a platform for independent film-makers, but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstream.\\n\\nSmaller festivals like Slamdance and XDance, which take place during the same week in Park City, are competing for Sundance\\'s limelight. But Redford is not worried. \"The more the merrier,\" he says. \"The point was to create opportunities for people who may not have them. \"Once independent film had a place where the work could be seen, suddenly the merchants came. With them the celebrities came, then the paparazzi - and suddenly it began to take on a whole new tone,\" explains Redford.\\n\\n\"People started to say we had gone mainstream and Hollywood, but actually Hollywood came to us because suddenly there was good business in independent film,\" he adds. International film-makers have always been celebrated here, but 2005 is the first year a dedicated World Dramatic and Documentary competition is being held.\\n\\nRedford wants the festival to encompass viewpoints he believes the American media fails to reflect, particularly how the US is perceived internationally. He has never hidden the fact that he is a Democrat. But he reserves particular disdain for the current Republican administration. \"It\\'s the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration,\" he says. \"I think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view. That\\'s very unhealthy and very dangerous.\\n\\n\"If we take that policy into the world, there will be the same victims and the same consequences.\" Sundance isn\\'t just one big screening. There are discussion panels and Q&A sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like America\\'s \"culture wars\" and the Iraq war. While Redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent, the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic. Educated, middle class and predominantly white Americans comes Sundance, with views from the same end of the political spectrum - anti-war and socially liberal. But Redford knows this and started the Sundance TV Channel in an effort to reach a wider audience. \"When you look at the films here, what we are presenting is very much egalitarian. And it\\'s about good films and good story-telling be it African America, Asian, women, gay, lesbian. \"Sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say \\'it\\'s just a film by so-and so\\'.\"\\n',\n",

It is the third year at Hogwarts and studies are interrupted, as they always are, by a calamity that only Harry, Ron and Hermione can put right.\\n\\nIt sounds corny. But Harry is no longer the winsome hero, he is a moody teenager and Daniel Radcliffe pulls it off very well. Emma Watson is ever better as Hermione, and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson. The film itself is the reason to buy this DVD. But it is laden with behind-the-scenes extras, including funny, if shallow, interviews with all the main cast. But what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch. Younger viewers will go for the games which include a Magic You May Have Missed memory test, and Crookshanks chasing off after Scabbers. Adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes. You will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage - and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it, as we did on the first Harry Potter DVD.

              " 'Director Nair\\'s Vanity project\\n\\n\\n\\nThe book is one of the classics of English literature - the story of scheming 19th Century social climber Becky Sharp, played in the film by Reese Witherspoon. Nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film, which she has - controversially - made in a Bollywood style, including two song-and-dance routines in the film\\'s second half. \"It was serendipity really - I was offered Vanity Fair by the studio Focus Features, who had distributed Monsoon Wedding,\" Nair told BBC World Service\\'s Masterpiece programme. \"They offered me their next-best thing, not realising that Vanity Fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since I was 16 years old in an Irish Catholic boarding school in India.\"\\n\\nSince her 1988 debut feature Salaam Bombay! - nominated for the Best Foreign Language Oscar and winner of Best First Feature at Cannes - Nair has become one of India\\'s most famous and respected directors. She is not restricted to Bollywood, however - she followed Salaam Bombay! with Mississippi Masala, starring Denzel Washington, and The Perez Family, her first Hollywood film.\\n\\nHer career peaked with Monsoon Wedding in 2001, which won the Golden Lion award at Venice. Nair\\'s Indian-style adaptation of Vanity Fair, however, has been attacked by critics in the US - where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week - who described the Bollywood elements as \"jarring.\" The film has a new ending, with Becky Sharp running off for a new life in India. But Nair said that her film had picked up on the way Thackeray - who was born in India but moved to England as a young man - had seen the world. \"First, when I was 16, it was Becky Sharp, who is a completely memorable character, because I recognised myself in her - I recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies, who wanted to buck the system that they were in,\" she said. \"But it was the sort of novel I somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years, and I would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again. \"As I got older and read it, I think it was Thackeray\\'s clarity - his clear-sightedness about his own society, the fact that he was born in India but came to England as a young man - that gave him the eyes of an outsider, and yet he was an insider. \"That perspective was something I really loved.\"\\n\\nNair also defended her decision to cast an American actress - Reese Witherspoon - as Becky Sharp, despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are British or Irish. \"I cast intuitively - in my films I cast as many non-actors as I cast actors,\" she said. \"For me, it is intuition - I have to fall in love with an actor. It is a visceral response.\\n\\n\"Thackeray describes Becky Sharp as a minx. Also she\\'s described as someone who\\'s tiny, red-headed and thin. Reese had that completely minx-like irresistibility about her.\" Having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part, however, Witherspoon then became pregnant. But Nair said that, though this had created the need for some filming tricks, it had in fact also helped the film. \"It was a self-fulfilling prophesy - when I first met her husband [actor Ryan Philippe], I said \\'knock her up, won\\'t you, I need some flesh on the girl\\',\" she joked. \"I\\'m not a fan of the underfed Los Angeles actor at all. This was, for me, about Becky Sharp being, eventually, a full-blown woman through the course of the film. \"I love the luminosity that pregnancy brings, I love the fleshiness, I love the ample bosom - it gave me much more to play with.\" Nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise Witherspoon\\'s \"bump\" in various scenes - including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her. \"She runs, she gets off coal carts, she jumps off horses - she does everything,\" Nair said. \"But there\\'s also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment, because of the bump.\"\\n',\n",

But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations.\\n\\nLast November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet\\'s right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films \"of French expression\", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin\\'s Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche\\'s L\\'Esquive and France\\'s number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus.\\n\\nBest actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L\\'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. Tautou will compete against Maggie Cheung , Emmanuelle Devos, Yolande Moreau and Karin Viard for best actress. Michael Moore\\'s Fahrenheit 9/11, The Motorcycle Diaries, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 21 Grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize.

The Aviator leads the shortlist, but critics believe the night may belong to Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby. A recent poll of US pundits found Eastwood\\'s boxing drama had become the new favourite to win best film over the Howard Hughes biopic.\\n\\nIf the 74-year-old does win, he will become the oldest person ever to be named best director at the ceremony. UK critics still favour The Aviator for best film, but believe the best director title will generate a close fought battle between Eastwood and Martin Scorsese.\\n\\nScorsese has never won the best director prize, despite four previous nominations for films including Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Gangs of New York. Eastwood has won best director once before, for Unforgiven in 1993. Most experts predict the twice-nominated Jamie Foxx will win best actor for his portrayal of singer Ray Charles, while Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton looks likely to lose out in the best actress field to Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. The UK\\'s highest hopes remain with Clive Owen, who has scooped both the Golden Globe and the Bafta for his supporting role in Closer. Actor and comedian Chris Rock will host the event, which will be broadcast with a seven-second time delay to allow censors to cut out any unsuitable content.\\n\\n\"We have the bleep machine ready, but bleeps will be used as needed,\" producer Gil Cates told reporters. However, he added that he strongly disapproved of the growing tendency to censor live broadcasts on US TV.\\n\\nHe also played down fears that Rock, who is known for using strong language in his stand-up routines, might cause controversy on the night. The 40-year-old comic has already promised not to swear live on air during the show. \"Chris has a sense of humour and everything he says is really said humorously,\" Cates said. \"You need a movie star and someone who is a stand-up comic so they can deal with the vicissitudes of the show.\" Security will also be tight, with police employing a system to detect sarin nerve gas. \"We are pulling out all the stops,\" said John Miller, chief of counterterrorism at the Los Angeles Police Department. The show is \"a symbol of American culture and has the potential to be a high-visibility target,\" he added. Meanwhile, organisers have erected a canopy over the red carpet following an outbreak of torrential rain in Los Angeles over the past week. Cates said the covers would be removed if the threat of wet weather receded. Details have also emerged of the contents of this year\\'s gift bags, which are given to nominees and presenters on the night. This year\\'s bags will include a gift certificate for a luxury beach resort, a pair of mink eyelashes and a kitchen set with a year\\'s supply of tea and coffee.

              " 'US box office set for record high\\n\\nTicket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002\\'s all-time high.\\n\\nOverall figures could be dampened by the lack of a Christmas hit like last year\\'s Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings. Traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. According to Exhibitor Relations President Paul Dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.\\n\\n\"Many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,\" said Mr Dergarabedian. He added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as Napoleon Dynamite and critical hit Sideways. Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. Sony Pictures Entertainment vice chairman. Jeff Blake said: \"We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge.\" Horror movie The Grudge cost Sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. It\\'s the latest in a recent trend for Hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.\\n',\n",

Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was \"heart-wrenching\". \"It\\'s very emotional, it even makes grown men cry,\" she said. \"The Aviator is a gorgeous movie, but it\\'s colder.\"\\n\\nIn the acting categories, Foxx is regarded as almost unbeatable for his performance as Ray Charles in Ray. \"The performance is based on a real person who was a showbusiness hero with a handicap, who recently died,\" O\\'Neil said. \"He has unstoppable momentum among the voters.\" Hilary Swank is the favourite to win best actress for the second time in six years. She previously won in 1999 for her performance in Boys Don\\'t Cry. In the supporting categories, Cate Blanchett is tipped to win for her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman is favourite to take home his first ever Oscar, for Million Dollar Baby.

Directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev, The Return previously won the 2003 Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.

The winner was chosen by a panel which included X Files actress Gillian Anderson, critic Roger Clarke and Touching the Void director Kevin McDonald.\\n\\nRoss, who is the presenter of BBC One's Film 2005, was also involved in the deliberations. A shortlist of six films from around the world had been drawn up from which the panel chose. Other nominees included the Motorcycle Diaries, Zatoichi and Hero. A viewer poll saw director Zhang Yimou's martial arts epic Hero emerge as the favourite with 32% of votes cast. Tragedy struck the production of The Return when one of the young stars, 15-year-old Vladimir Girin, drowned in a lake where some of the film's scenes were set.

Dirty War - screened uncut on BBC One last September - depicts a dirty bomb attack on the City of London. It is also being screened uncut on US cable channel HBO on 24 January. PBS said it will use extra footage for its broadcast, showing the woman \"from a more discreet angle\" instead.\\n\\nThe US Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 (£306,814) last autumn for singer Janet Jackson\\'s \"wardrobe malfunction\", during which her breast was exposed during a dance routine with Justin Timberlake. Many US networks and broadcasters are now more nervous about airing nudity, violence or bad language. Ms Atlas said PBS could put itself financially at risk if it showed the uncut version of Dirty War, and it could also deter many of its 170 individual stations from airing \"an important film\". \"You want to pick your battles,\" she said. She added that PBS, which is a private, non-profit media enterprise owned and operated by the nation\\'s 349 public television stations, is bolder about screening non-fiction or historical programming.

The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.\\n\\nUp to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them. The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off. Mr Evans sued Mr Mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded DiCaprio to play Hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. The two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact Mr Evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.\\n\\nAmpas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. The eligible names for The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby were decided by Ampas' producers branch executive committee on Wednesday.

The director of the film, Vinod Pande, says the movie is not offensive and has refused to withdraw it. Catholics are planning a protest in Mumbai (Bombay) on Wednesday. The president of one of Mumbai\\'s main Catholic organisations, Dolphy D\\'Souza, says the portrayal of an ordained priest as a man of loose moral character has hurt the religious sentiments of India\\'s Catholic community.\\n\\nHe called the film \"pornographic and sensational\". Mr D\\'Souza, who is also the vice-president of the Catholics\\' national body, has accused the director of the film of portraying a priest in bad light for commercial gains.

It took $19.1m (£9.9m) on Christmas Day alone, the highest takings on that day in box office history. The sequel to the Ben Stiller comedy Meet The Parents stars Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The success of Meet the Fockers could help produce record box office revenue for 2004, said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the industry\\'s tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"We\\'ve had a much stronger than anticipated final week of the year that helped the industry end on a high note,\" said Mr Dergarabedian.\\n\\nMeet the Fockers also broke the box office records for the most money taken on New Year\\'s Eve, when it made $12.2m (£6.2m), and New Year\\'s Day, when it took $18m (£9.4m). The previous New Year\\'s Eve record was set in 2000 by Cast Away with $8.5m (£4.5m). The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King had held the New Year\\'s Day title with $12.8m (£6.7m). However, Christmas takings were down 26.5% on 2003\\'s figures - which was blamed on Christmas falling over a weekend this year. This weekend\\'s top 12 films took an estimated $125.4m (£65.8m), a 4.3% increase on the same weekend last year. But there were no major releases last week to provide competition to Meet the Fockers or Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events, which finished in second place with $14.7m (£7.7m). The Aviator, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, ended up in third position after taking $11.2m (£5.9m).

Other Scottish acts, such as the Mull Historical Society who also featured in the top 50, performed at a party in Glasgow where the result was announced. Scottish-based band Snow Patrol, who finished 14th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of Brit Awards, were among the performers who covered well-known Scottish pop songs at the party on Wednesday night.\\n\\nIndie stalwarts Belle & Sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to 1997.

Scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list, including 1970s tartan boy band the Bay City Rollers and goth favourites the Jesus and Mary Chain.\\n\\nScottish magazine The List recently compiled a list of the top 50 Scottish bands of all time, but left the final decision to the public. The magazine\\'s music editor Mark Robertson said: \"The idea behind the project was simple - to rediscover the very best of Scottish music, from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of 70s rock through to 80s pop, right up to today\\'s international stars.\" \"Everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,\" he added.

              " 'Dance music not dead says Fatboy\\n\\n\\n\\nThe commercial failure of the latest albums by Britain\\'s two biggest dance acts - Fatboy Slim\\'s Palookaville and The Prodigy\\'s Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many \"superclubs,\" and the folding of three dance music magazines. Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that \"dance music is no longer where it\\'s happening in music.\" These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. \"Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,\" he told BBC World Service\\'s The Ticket programme. \"I personally don\\'t believe it\\'s either dead or going to die, but it\\'s going through a bit of a fallow patch. \"So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think \\'right, scrub that track then\\'.\"\\n\\nAlthough his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year.\\n\\n\"With a crowd that big, if the weather\\'s nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think \\'I\\'ve got them\\',\" Cook said. \"I\\'m always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor. \"For some reason, especially now I\\'ve got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that\\'s already going on means all I have to do is play \\'up\\' records.\" He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. \"We\\'re having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there\\'s landlocked countries that want to get involved,\" Cook said. \"We\\'re doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.\"\\n\\nThe DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe.\\n\\n\"The tabloid thing has been difficult at times,\" Cook said. \"Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - it\\'s quite scary.\" He said that he had been \"determined\" that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album. \"At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn\\'t think I was depressed,\" he explained. \"Then I thought, \\'that\\'s not right\\'.\" And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. \"I said to Zoe, \\'I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if it\\'s on the album?\\'\" he recalled. \"She said, \\'yeah, it\\'s hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you\\'.\" Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour. \"It\\'s almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,\" Cook explained. \"If there\\'s a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other\\'s doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don\\'t know who they\\'re after.\"\\n',\n",

They have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidental.\\n\\nThe head of Christian Brothers\\' school St Fintian\\'s, Richard Fogarty, said the video implied that the 24-year-old pop star had attended his school and was abused there. \"The school has always treated its pupils with respect,\" Mr Fogarty said in a statement.

Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland. Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John.\\n\\nSir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project. \"It\\'s a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, \\'it\\'s such a good song\\', but it\\'s such a sad song,\" Read said.\\n\\nHe said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a \"sing-along\" like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa. The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. \"I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,\" he said.

Their self-titled debut album won last year\\'s Mercury Music Prize and spawned three top 20 singles. He told the 300-strong audience at the University\\'s Reid Hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes. \"We say \\'I like this\\'. Because I listen to Nirvana and Korn I am a troubled individual, I\\'m riddled with angst because I listen to Chopin and Debussy, I listen to Kylie Minogue and Scissor Sisters because I\\'m upbeat and I like to party, I listen to Wagner because I like the smell of napalm in the morning.\" Kapranos said there was a general \"hostility\" towards classical music, adding: \"There is very little done to break that hostility other than Classic FM.\"\\n\\nHe concluded: \"We define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity.\" Fellow speaker and classical composer James MacMillan agreed: \"We need to rediscover our ability to listen.\" Previous speakers at the Edinburgh Lectures series have included former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and author Professor Stephen Hawking. Kapranos described his appearance on Wednesday as \"more daunting by a long way\" than their upcoming Brits performance. \"I don\\'t really care about the Brits,\" he said. \"It\\'s going to be great to go down but I have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonight.\"\\n\\nI think the government should do more to help up-and-coming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues. Also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labels.\\n\\nRather than expecting the government - i.e. the taxpayer - to fork out, why don\\'t some of the megastars put something back in? Some of Britain\\'s wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. There are far more important demands on government funds.\\n\\nIf they can fund football, why not fund music?\\n\\nAreas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? We already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. The only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.\\n\\nThe government has enough problems funding schools and health services. If Alex Kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.\\n\\nAs a Scot living in England, I appreciate the value of Scottish music and culture being a success, so I can see no problem with it! Franz Ferdinand, Travis and Snow Patrol are just recent examples of the success Scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we Scots are good at and support our own goods!\\n\\nI think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? The answer is most definitely no. Those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn\\'t be looking for government subsidies. I know that if I was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping I would want to finance myself until I was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.\\n\\nYes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.\\n\\nThere are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the \"new deal\". Getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.\\n\\nAs long as the Government was funding real talent it would be a great move. I would hate to see more Pop Idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that Alex talked about.\\n\\nOnly if the proposals make financial sense. Franz Ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they\\'d had a government grant to get started they\\'d have more than paid it back by now, so the Treasury would be making far more than it paid out. However, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they\\'re a musician. The government shouldn\\'t \"fund\" music - it should \"invest\" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.\\n\\nI think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. The equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. However, I do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.\\n\\nI do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! They generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! If labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn\\'t have to fork out a great deal.\\n\\nYeah, why not? Music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. Pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternities\\n\\nI agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but I am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. There is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. Perhaps we could financially penalise really bad Pop Idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. Call it a tax on music \"pollution\", if you like.\\n\\nThough I really like Franz Ferdinand, I have to disagree with Mr Kapranos. Once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. Many years ago, this was the case with the US NEA, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. The solution Mr Kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like Save the Music in the US.\\n',\n",

Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show.

His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event. Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Diana Ross, Gloria Estefan and Phil Collins are among the stars who have previously graced the Super Bowl stage.\\n',\n",

Rock band Keane won Sound of 2004 while US rapper 50 Cent topped Sound of 2003. Other new artists in this year\\'s list include London indie group Bloc Party at second and UK rapper Kano third. The Bravery played their first gig in 2003 and have since supported bands including The Libertines, Interpol and Echo and the Bunnymen.\\n\\nThey were the subject of a record company bidding war in 2004 and their debut single, Unconditional, caused a huge buzz when it was released in the UK in November. Singer Sam Endicott said he felt \"great\" about coming top of the Sound of 2005 list. \"Anyone that says they don\\'t want a zillion screaming fans is a jackass, a liar,\" he said. One of the experts to tip The Bravery was The Times\\' music critic Paul Connolly, who said they were \"spiky but in love with pop\". Chris Hawkins, host of BBC 6 Music\\'s chart show, said the band had \"great guitars and a mastery of the electro-clash sound\". \"The Bravery are proof alone that New York City is still home to hot new talent,\" he said. Nigel Harding, head of music at London rock radio station Xfm, said every track from their live set \"sounded like a potential single\".\\n\\nUnconditional reached the summit of the station\\'s listeners\\' chart within a fortnight of its first play, which Mr Harding described as \"an unheard of achievement for a debut single\".\\n\\nQ magazine reviews editor Ted Kessler said they were \"pretty-boy New York clothes horses\" with \"an unusually nimble ear for concise, yearning pop in the mould of Duran Duran or The Strokes\". Other pundits to take part in the survey included BBC Radio 1 DJ Trevor Nelson, NME editor Conor McNicholas, Top of the Pops presenter Fearne Cotton, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis and BBC Radio 2 music editor Colin Martin. Elsewhere on the top 10, second-placed rock band Bloc Party began their rise after supporting Franz Ferdinand and UK garage MC Kano, in third, is signed to The Streets\\' record label. US rapper The Game is hip-hop great Dr Dre\\'s latest protege while Leeds group Kaiser Chiefs came fifth with a promise to lead a Britpop revival.

In the survey, the pundits were asked for tips for three acts they thought were capable of reaching the top in their chosen genre, either in terms of sales or critical acclaim. The artists could be from any country and any musical genre, but must not have had a UK top 20 single, been a contestant on a TV talent show or already be famous for doing something else, such as a soap actor.

Last year, Jackson exposed a breast during a dance routine, causing outrage among millions of TV viewers and landing the CBS TV network a fine. Sir Paul, however, did nothing more racy than remove his jacket as he sang. Organisers were widely considered to be playing it safe this year by booking 62-year-old Sir Paul for his second Super Bowl show.\\n\\nThree years ago, he was invited to perform at the first Super Bowl after the September 11 attacks and performed his specially-written song Freedom. This time, he started off the show, at the Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, with the Beatles numbers Drive My Car and Get Back. He then performed a mellow version of Live And Let Die, the James Bond theme he recorded with the band Wings. Finally, he closed the show with a rousing version of Hey Jude. The former Beatle resisted any temptation to refer to Janet Jackson\\'s headline-grabbing performance last year, instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot. The singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show - but any fans hoping for a second \"Nipple-gate\" were to be disappointed as he kept his red sweatshirt on underneath.\\n\\nEarlier, the Black Eyed Peas and Alicia Keys had provided the night\\'s other high-profile entertainment by performing in a pre-game show. Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie was dressed in a tight orange top and purple hotpants, but nothing in her performance was likely to upset TV watchdogs. After the controversy last year - which saw CBS fined a record $550,000 (£292,000) by federal regulators - Super Bowl organisers had turned to producer Don Mischer to oversee this year\\'s half-time show. His previous production credits included Olympic opening and closing ceremonies. The Super Bowl is watched by an audience of 144.4 million in the US, with many of the people watching are said to tune in specifically to see the entertainment put on around the event.

Although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample, Mr Newton said his copyright had been infringed. But the US Court of Appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition. The Beastie Boys - Michael Diamond, Adam Horowitz, and Adam Yauch - are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling music.\\n\\nSampling, now a standard practice among musicians, involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song. A three-judge panel of the court held in 2003 that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of Mr Newton\\'s recording. That finding upheld a lower-court dismissal of the case in favour of the Beastie Boys. \"We hold that Beastie Boys\\' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of Newton\\'s copyright,\" Chief Judge Mary Schroeder wrote in her opinion.

At the time, police said a \"physical altercation\" broke out among the musicians at about 0200 local time. That led to one of the group being \"jostled\" and falling onto the table of five Italian guests - causing the fight, they said. The fight continued outside, where \"one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher... and suffered minor injuries\", they said.\\n',\n",

The dispute between Love and surviving band members Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl was settled in 2002. Work began on the box set in 1998, but legal battles put the project on hold.

The DVD also includes the first performance of Smells Like Teen Spirit, the track that launched Nirvana on to the international stage in 1991. \"The band wasn\\'t always pretty, or always in tune. This is not Nirvana unplugged. It\\'s Nirvana unedited,\" said Cobain biographer Charles Cross.

Lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. The issue was discussed at a major science conference in Washington DC. Crime Scene Investigation (CSI) and its spin-offs, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nEach episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. \"The CSI effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the TV show,\" said Max Houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at West Virginia University, US. \"This TV show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,\" he told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). The American forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged DNA samples in US labs. Yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said Dr Houck. Forensic pathologist Dr Patricia McFeeley said she had started to see the show\\'s influence in dealing with the families of victims. \"What I find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,\" she explained. \"For example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. But when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult.\"\\n\\nDr McFeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people\\'s perceptions. The show\\'s influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. \"Prosecutors fear the CSI effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: \\'why wasn\\'t everything tested?\\' Well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,\" Dr Houck explained. \"Defence attorneys also worry about the CSI effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that\\'s always accurate.\" However, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. \"My university course started with four graduates in 1999; we\\'re now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,\" he said. Dr Houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: \"There\\'s more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.\"\\n',\n",

Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: \"Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - it\\'s one of the best shows on TV in the last decade.\" Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.\\n\\nIn winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original.

Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October. All three will play \"diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial\" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show.\\n\\nRadio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the \"challenge\" of \"keeping his legacy alive\" with unpredictable music. The three DJs were chosen for their \"in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres\", the station said.\\n\\nRob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales. And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1\\'s digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week.\\n\\nGood luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it\\'s probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed.\\n\\nVery good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations!\\n\\nThe whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq.\\n\\nThe obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com. This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today. Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel. BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.\\n',\n",

The FCC was looking into 50 shows, including those by \"shock jock\" Howard Stern and two New York DJs. Stern recently announced he was leaving Viacom while the two DJs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. After the church incident two years ago Viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.\\n\\nIt also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. The agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said Richard Diamond, FCC deputy secretary of communications. The shows were broadcast by Viacom-owned stations across the United States. Viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. The payment is not related to the FCC\\'s $550,000 (£293,000) fine levied against Viacom after the exposure of singer Janet Jackson\\'s breast during the CBS Super Bowl halftime show in January. Viacom is contesting that fine. It is not the first time that Viacom has paid out over indecency charges.

Although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated, the MPs said. The call was made in a report into the BBC\\'s Freeview digital service. \"Our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of EastEnders but simply to ensure that the BBC is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money,\" said the committee chairman, MP Edward Leigh. \"The BBC\\'s spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny, and accountability to parliament. \"Parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general, on behalf of parliament, to be able to scrutinise how that money, over £2 billion a year, is used.\"\\n\\nA BBC spokeswoman said: \"We share the committee\\'s interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well. Though in its infancy, we think the arrangements with the NAO are working well and should be given time to mature.\" The report said the Freeview digital service has had an \"impressive\" take up since its launch but the BBC must still dispel confusion about the service. The committee found the BBC had succeeded in ensuring subscription-free access to digital channels following the collapse of ITV Digital in 2002. But the fact that one in four homes could not access Freeview remained a problem.\\n\\nThe report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues, there was need for detailed explanations on the Freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas. The government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal, with 2012 the most recently proposed date. The BBC launched Freeview in 2002 as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as Sky, to allow its digital channels such as BBC Three and News 24 to be seen. There have been an estimated five million Freeview set-top boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably. The corporation plans to spend up to £138m on Freeview before 2014 to ensure people can receive the service throughout the UK, and are aware of it.\\n',\n",

It runs daily, not only on the television but also on the radio. Every Friday, hundreds of people gather in Luanda\\'s Independence Square to record a message in front of the TV cameras, in the hope that a lost relative will see it. Many relatives have been reunited on air. \"At the beginning there was an absolute explosion - huge, huge crowds,\" Sergio Gera, the programme\\'s chief co-ordinator, told BBC World Service\\'s Assignment programme. \"Now things are a little calmer, there are slightly less people - but, after two and a half years of broadcasting, there are still a lot of people going.\"\\n\\nThe media in the southern African country, twice the size of France, has been gripped by the quest of so many people to find their relatives. Hundreds of thousands of people died in Angola\\'s 30-year civil war, which finally ended in 2002, and tens of thousands of people are still missing. Many have not heard anything for 10 or more years - in all, 90% of Angolan families have lost someone.\\n\\nThe idea of recording in Independence Square was modelled on a square in the Argentine capital Buenos Aries, where mothers go to talk about the dead and the missing, and to exchange news. One woman, Victoria Lapete, found her sister - the only remaining member of her family - in Independence Square live on Meeting Point. She had not seen her sibling for 28 years. \"When we saw each other, we threw ourselves into each other\\'s arms,\" she told Assignment. \"We started to cry. I felt very, very happy, because I\\'d spent so long without any family. Suddenly I had a sister again.\" However, Angola is one of the poorest countries in Africa, and the number of people with access to either a television or radio is comparatively few. This means that elsewhere in the country, the task of reuniting families lies primarily with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). In the city of Wambo, the ICRC runs the Gazetta - a 200-page, tabloid-size book which contains 13,000 names of missing or displaced.\\n\\nTheir task is made much harder by the huge number of landmines dotted around the country. \"It\\'s very difficult - there are many displaced,\" stated Joaquim Sahundi, head of tracing in Wambo.\\n\\n\"As they try to go back [home], others are trying to relocate their relatives. Many people are getting injured because of that - in the villages, in the bush, there has been no clearance of mines. \"When people are crossing these areas, they step on mines.\" The ICRC also uses the media where it can, running four daily broadcasts of their lists of the missing on Radio Angola. Meanwhile, there remain massive challenges to Angolan families even once they are reunited. \"The programme of family reunification is extremely important, but for these families to remain reunified, there has to be social integration, job access, education, healthcare,\" said Rafael Marques of the pro-democracy George Soros Foundation for Southern Africa. \"Essentially the government is waiting for the international community to pay for the reconstruction - that\\'s why it has been persistently calling for a donor\\'s conference. That is just a way of detaching itself from its political responsibilities.\"\\n',\n",

              " 'Franz Ferdinand\\'s art school lesson\\n\\n\\n\\nWith their self-titled debut, Franz Ferdinand have achieved what most rock bands crave - high credibility and critical acclaim while also selling stacks of CDs. They have risen to the head of the UK\\'s art rock ranks with an album of songs that are catchy, creative and original enough to sound fresh. With a cool, spiky, fun sound previously associated with bands like Talking Heads, they hit upon a style that had been out of fashion for a while and so was ripe for another airing. Their first UK single hit number three last January, followed by two more top 20 hits, while the album has sold more than 600,000 copies in 11 months on release. In September it was named album of the year winning the prestigious Mercury Music Prize.\\n\\nOn the festivals circuit, they have been one of the main attractions for huge crowds at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Reading/Leeds. They have also found success in Japan, Europe and the US. By September the album had sold 500,000 in the States and total sales were pushing two million worldwide. They have been nominated for three Grammy awards in the US as well as the US music industry\\'s Shortlist award, but lost the Shortlist prize to US band TV on the Radio. Nevertheless Franz Ferdinand were the only UK band to win an MTV Video Music Award this year, taking the breakthrough video crown for Take Me Out.\\n\\nThe four-piece met two years ago when drummer Paul Thomson was working at the Glasgow art school where bassist Bob Hardy was studying. Singer Alex Kapranos was studying English at university but had friends at art school, and the line-up was completed when guitarist Nick McCarthy moved from Munich, Germany, to the city. At the turn of the year, Kapranos told BBC News Online the band were fed up with serious bands in \"that post-rock thing that seemed to be doing its damndest to avoid any bloody tune\".\\n\\n\"We want people to go away from the gigs humming the tunes that we were singing. But at the same time bringing an edge to it.\" Franz Ferdinand had a question they asked themselves every time they wrote a song, Kapranos said. \"Where\\'s the fun in that?\" they pondered at every stage, making enjoyment the top priority and ensuring they did not disappear up their own muso posteriors. The band started out with a DIY ethic that saw them take over a disused art-deco warehouse in Glasgow and rename it The Chateau. The venue soon became legendary - so well-known that the police spent a month trying to find it, eventually raiding it and arresting Kapranos. But the charges of running an illegal bar and contravening health and safety, fire hazard and noise abatement laws were dropped.\\n\\nThe band took over an abandoned Victorian courtroom and jail instead, and named that The Chateau. The buzz about the band soon spread around the music industry and 40 record labels turned up to one gig in Glasgow - which the band thought was \"totally ridiculous\". \"I\\'m really glad it was almost comical because we weren\\'t overwhelmed by the seriousness of it,\" Kapranos said. They signed with independent label Domino, home of Smog, Sebadoh and Four Tet, in June 2003.\\n',\n",

She said she was \"horrified\" by the deaths of Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17. Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was \"nothing to be glamorised\".\\n\\nThere were more than 10,500 firearms offences and 70 gun crime deaths in England and Wales between June 2003 and 2004, according to Home Office figures. Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight\\'s Birmingham home.\\n\\n\"It haunted me to be honest, it haunted my sleep,\" she said. Size became involved after two friends, Donna Small and Asha Jama, were shot in his Bristol hometown in October. Jama, 25, lost her sight in one eye while 22-year-old Small suffered serious head injuries. Size said he collaborated on the single, which was released on Monday, because he has \"a bird\\'s eye view of what\\'s going on\". \"Over the last 10 years, I have seen a lot of things happen and it is nothing to be glamorised, it really isn\\'t,\" he said.\\n',\n",

We took some time off for Christmas, but generally we\\'re doing another record,\" Barrow told the digital radio station. News of their album plans comes after confirmation the Bristol band will play a tsunami charity show next month. Portishead will play alongside fellow Bristol band Massive Attack at Oxfam\\'s Tsumani appeal, held at the Bristol Academy on 19 February. Barrow said he was surprised people thought the band, who won a Mercury Music Prize in 1995 for their debut album Dummy, had split up.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve just had our heads down really, we\\'ve never actually broken up, or parted, or whatever. \"So for us it just seems, even though we haven\\'t played for years, we still see each other and write - we just haven\\'t released a record for a long time.\" Portishead will not play any new material at next month\\'s concert, which will feature singer Beth Gibbons playing with an acoustic backing. Other acts appearing include Liverpool band The Coral and former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant. Portishead became an international success and a deeply influential band despite their scant recorded output. Dummy was a critics\\' favourite in 1994, hailed for its blend of menacing sounds and hip-hop beats married to old soul samples. The follow up, Portishead, was released three years later.\\n',\n",

Confirmation of Busted\\'s long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was \"devastated\" to hear of Simpson\\'s departure. \"This has been a really difficult decision,\" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, \"I hope the fans will understand.\"\\n\\nWhile Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted\\'s enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday\\'s press conference coinciding with the start of the band\\'s 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie\\'s first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick\\'s Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue\\'s Promotions Coordinator, said: \"Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm.\"\\n\\nWith queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson\\'s brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson\\'s guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar\\'s blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted\\'s chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: \"I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. \"I\\'ve never heard them before, but I\\'m pretty impressed.\" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, \"With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted\\'s sound, but they\\'re still not very inspiring.\" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.\\n',\n",

The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band\\'s self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record\\'s artwork.\\n\\nAfter becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.\\n\\nEdwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band\\'s US tour to promote The Holy Bible.

He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\" - were signed to indies. \"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\" he added. \"They can make more money that way - it\\'s a more generous relationship, and also it\\'s a more understanding relationship. \"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\"\\n',\n",

Many Jamaican entertainers have appeared before the courts for use of profanity in recent years but they usually receive a verbal warning, a suspended sentence or community service.

The campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a UK police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. Brett Lock of gay group OutRage! said they were \"wiping the slate clean\". The protests had been led by the Stop Murder Music coalition, an umbrella group including OutRage!, the Black Gay Men\\'s Advisory Group and Jamaican movement J-Flag.\\n\\nThat coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene\\'s biggest stars. But the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. And it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. \"The reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,\" according to media and PR strategist Glen Yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry.\\n\\nThe industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. \"We\\'ll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society.\" The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla\\'s UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August. Police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. The campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, Mr Yearwood admitted. \"If you can\\'t have major stars touring, then you don\\'t sell many albums,\" he said.\\n\\nBut the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. OutRage!\\'s Mr Lock said: \"The main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren\\'t any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. \"As a gesture of good faith, the Stop Murder Music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. \"So we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself.\" Record companies VP and Greensleeves, distributor Jet Star and concert promoters including Jammins and Apollo Entertainment are all on board.\\n',\n",

Meanwhile, Joss Stone performed Right To Be Wrong backed by a gospel choir, while Lemar and Jamelia performed the Robert Palmer track Addicted To Love. Bob Geldof won a prize for his outstanding contribution to music. Of the 15 Brit awards for achievements in 2004, 10 were won by artists tipped in the BBC News website\\'s Sound of 2004 list of artists to watch, published at the start of last year. Scissor Sisters, Franz Ferdinand, Keane, Joss Stone and McFly were all in the Sound of 2004 top 10. The other five Brits winners were already established before Sound of 2004 was compiled. The ceremony will be televised on ITV1 on Thursday.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m speechless. Best song of the last 25 years? Yeah right.\\n\\nI very much doubt that \\'Angels\\' was even the best song of the week that it came out. Like every track Robbie has released as a single, it\\'s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.\\n\\nGive us a break...!!!\\n\\nBest song in 25 years, you must be joking. Its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!\\n\\nListened to Angels on Radio 1 this morning when I was driving into work. Had not heard it for a while. I love Robs voice, the lyrics and tune. Perfection!\\n\\nAs usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for \"the greatest\". There must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. It\\'s not exactly groundbreaking. Presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...\\n\\nI\\'m actually embarrassed to be British if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!\\n\\nWhat about The Specials - Ghost Town, The Buzzcocks - Ever Fallen in Love With Someone... Happy Mondays - Kinky Afro, McAlmont & Butler - Yes, Joy Division - Love Will Tear Us Apart... Angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.\\n\\nAngels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. It\\'s musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like Mr Williams himself. This result isn\\'t very surprising though, The Brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!\\n\\nBest of the last 25 years? Maybe. Cunning to make the timescale not include Stairway to Heaven or Bohemian Rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. Not much competition in the last 25 years after all.\\n\\nIt\\'s alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???\\n\\nThere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it\\'s a travesty.\\n\\nRubbish! Who voted it for it to be included in any list? I am a regular listener to Radio 2 but I don\\'t recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn\\'t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly NOT the best song of the last 25 years. How depressing and just when we thought manufactured \\'pop\\' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from?\\n\\nWhile I am biassed in that I thought Love Will Tear Us Apart should have won, in all seriousness, I think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. Then again, well done Robbie, good show.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got to be kidding.\\n\\nAngels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. Only the best song to be up for nomination at the Brits.\\n\\nI think Angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but I don\\'t think its the best song from the past 25 years! Right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was Will Young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn\\'t that good! I\\'m happy for Robbie himself though!\\n\\nBest song in the last 25 years? What a Joke! Think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than Angels. Phil Collins doesn\\'t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? Angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. Soppy rubbish at best. Hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.\\n\\nSo boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in Britain today, for me it\\'s proof that music and democracy just don\\'t mix. Still, at least it wasn\\'t Will Young...\\n\\nOh it\\'s all just a bit of fun. People take these awards too seriously! Robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. Him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. Personally I wanted Will Young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!\\n\\nI hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!\\n\\nI agree about Angels. I never get fed up hearing it. Whenever the song comes on the radio I turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). The song makes me calm and serene and happy. Well done Robbie.\\n\\nI think that although Robbie Williams is a good performer, that Angels isn\\'t really that good a song. It certainly isn\\'t anywhere near as good as Love Will Tear Us Apart by Joy Division or Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush.\\n\\nAngels is a fantastic song. All credit to Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers. It\\'s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.\\n\\nRobbie did in no way deserve that mantle. Whenever we have these awards it is always \\'artists\\' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...We forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. They weren\\'t cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.\\n\\nYes Angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.\\n\\nI\\'ve always disliked Angels intensely. I believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of British pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as \"classic\" songwriting. It\\'s \\'orrible. It seems obvious to me that people who like Robbie are people who don\\'t particularly like music all that much. Folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. Angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer\\'s afternoon picnic. What a dreadful result. If you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don\\'t you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. Booo hisss\\n\\nAngels, best song? You are kidding, right? Last five years I might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. Did whoever voted for this actually have ANY music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? Really quite insulting to the British music industry of the past quarter of a century.\\n\\nNo surprise about Robbie Williams considering the list. Where on earth did the nominations list come from???? Compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? I mean, Will Young? Come on.\\n\\nWhat a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - I don\\'t think so!! What about all the REAL artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but Robbie Williams doesn\\'t even come close.\\n\\nWhat a joke. That song has become such a bane to me that I have developed a Pavlovian response to the word \\'Angels\\' where I thrash around, and scream \"no no no no no\" until someone tells me \"the radio\\'s off\". Why a half-baked cheesy ditty like Angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on Pop Idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. If this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.\\n\\nWhy do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? The initial list was very weak anyway, but Angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! I think not, I didn\\'t realize Radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!\\n\\nPeople have such short memories! A great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? Not a chance. I think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.\\n\\nThe Great British Public at work again. It\\'s a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. Granted, it\\'s not too bad, either. But can it stand up against ANYTHING by The Smiths (in particular \"How Soon is Now?\") or anything from the Stone Roses\\' first album? Nope.\\n\\nNo, Because I\\'m not female and I\\'m not 10!\\n\\nOk I like Robbie and Angels is a decent song. But it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! The shortlist wasn\\'t great but him winning it is a joke!\\n\\nPredictable and laughable.\\n\\nThe success of Angels at this years Brits reflects poorly on the state of British music over the last 25 years. The British public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. Whilst Angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in Robbie\\'s repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.\\n\\nI am a huge Robbie fan and love that song. But I think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.\\n\\nHave Radio 2 listeners even heard of Joy Division? A band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than Robbie Williams ever will.\\n\\nNo doubt about it. There\\'s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. Some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but Angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.\\n\\nIt should have been Joy Division.Those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while Angels remains yet another pop song. I sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that Robbie Williams inspired their art in the way that the Byrds, the Beatles and Nick Drake have done for music today.\\n\\nYes!! I think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. There were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! Robbie was a deserved winner.\\n\\nI am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it\\'s a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don\\'t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.\\n\\nThe best song of the past 25 years? Really? Come on, this is surely a joke? No? I think I need a long lie down...\\n\\nIt just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick Robbie Williams over the beautifully talented Kate Bush and Joy Division. I suppose it\\'s confirmed one thing - the British public are consistently dull :- &lt;(\\n\\nNo offence Robbie, but pleeease! There must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. No one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of British music, and a further nail in the coffin!\\n\\nI think Robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in Britain since John Lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. Anybody who says he doesn\\'t deserve it is jealous of his success. The only real challenger was Queen but hey, Another One Bites the Dust!!\\n\\nObviously all the Karaoke singers in the UK voted for it.\\n\\nIf this is the best song of the last 25 years then the British Music industry is in trouble. Sure Robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.\\n\\nA sad day for music\\n\\nIt\\'s not the type of music I normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, I recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. That\\'s why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. It\\'s a good all-rounder. Just like Robbie.\\n\\nBest song in 25 years? Since 1980? I\\'m confused. \"Angels\" isn\\'t a bad song. It\\'s a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. But this is not great music. If anything it\\'s regressive. Bland even. I suppose it\\'s just more evidence of how redundant the Brit Awards have become.\\n\\nGranted angels is a good song, however it really wasn\\'t up against any other proper competition. The Queen\\'s song was lackluster, and apart from Kate Bush, the other choices were pathetic! Also, why weren\\'t the Stones there, David Bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than Angels...I wonder if it was simply the fact that Robbie wasn\\'t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!\\n\\nBest song of the last 25 years? What a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. Sigh. On the upside, at least it wasn\\'t Bohemian Rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful.\\n\\nAngels is without doubt a great song but I really don\\'t think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on Robbies\\' goodlooks than the actual song!!! Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.\\n\\nIt would have been a travesty had Angels not won. Without Angels, Robbie Williams may well not be where he is now, and Britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. It has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. Well done Rob.\\n\\nI find it hard to believe that \\'Angels\\' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! I\\'m rapidly redifining \\'best\\' in my own head now to mean \\'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning\\'. What about Britpop? Blur, Oasis, Suede, Pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. Why must \\'best\\' always come down to most commercially popular?\\n\\nI\\'ve nothing against Robbie, I actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? The Brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. The same goes with the Scissor Sisters, I think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near U2\\'s new record, neither are they in the same league. Once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.\\n\\nNo surprise really, it\\'s voted for by the general public. Since when did they have taste in music?\\n\\nPersonally I find Angels by Robbie Williams to be one of the most irritating songs I have ever heard!\\n\\nIt absolutely deserved to win. It is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.\\n\\nIt\\'s an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. All in all a pretty pointless exercise !\\n\\nThe song is overplayed and oversentimental. Out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either Joy Division or Queen. I suppose we should be thankful that it didn\\'t end up in the hands of Will Young though.\\n\\nAlthough it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. Everybody knows the words to Bohemian Rhapsody, Nothing Compares 2 U, etc. Much better songs and more timeless. Give it to someone with real talent.\\n\\nAlthough Angels is a good song I think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. This is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. Why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that\\'s all it means!\\n',\n",
              " 'Jamelia\\'s return to the top\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18. She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man. She racked up five Mobo nominations in 2000, winning one for best video. But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001. While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself. Her comeback song Bout featuring Rah Digga only just scrapped into the top 40.\\n\\nIt was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain\\'s most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti.\\n\\nSuperstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts. The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia. Next came the song See It In A Boy\\'s Eyes, which was especially written for her by Coldplay\\'s Chris Martin. His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B. She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair. Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. \"When I first got into the industry, I\\'d be away from home for months at a time. But now I have other things in my life. I still want to make it, but it\\'s not the end of the world if I don\\'t,\" commented Jamelia.\\n',\n",
              " 'Cult band Kasabian surge forward\\n\\n\\n\\nThe four-piece Leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning Kasabian places on the best British group, rock act and live act shortlists. They have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow Brit nominees such as Keane and Snow Patrol. \"British music needs a kick up the arse and Britain needs a new band to breathe life into the British people again,\" declared Kasabian\\'s singer Tom Meighan.\\n\\n\"No-one\\'s doing it at the minute. Music feels like it\\'s in the afterlife right now. We don\\'t want people to give up on it. \"The serpent\\'s going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!\" Meighan grew up in Leicester with Kasabian songwriter/guitarist Sergio Pizzorno and bassist Chris Edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.\\n\\nThey enlisted guitarist and keyboard player Christopher Karloff after spotting him in a pub. \"We saw his long sideburns and thought \\'hey, he looks the part, we\\'ll ask him,\\'\" said Meighan. Inspired by Britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound. \"We got a computer and we cut rock\\'n\\'roll up, because there\\'s no point in going back to how it was,\" said Meighan. \"It\\'s all about new ideas and creativity.\"\\n\\nThe band\\'s original approach is reflected in its name, inspired by Linda Kasabian - the getaway driver of US serial killer Charles Manson. Coincidentally it is also the Armenian term for \"butcher\". Kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in Rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. Signed to the RCA record label, Kasabian tested the water with two singles, Club Foot and LSF, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the UK singles chart respectively.\\n\\nThey built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both Glastonbury and T in the Park, and at a series of \"guerilla gigs\" at unusual venues including Half Time Orange, a pub next to Leicester City football club\\'s headquarters. Kasabian\\'s self-titled album was released last September to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to The Stone Roses, Primal Scream and The Happy Mondays.\\n\\nRegarding it as \"both a fiery assertion of rock \\'n\\' roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of Rutland Water\", the NME\\'s praise was typical of the album\\'s reception. As 2004 progressed Kasabian would score a further two hits - Processed Beats and Cutt Off - and embark upon a well-received UK tour. \"We take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,\" said Pizzorno. \"This is not a job to us,\" added Meighan. \"This is the best life we could ever have. This is what it\\'s all about and without it we\\'d be lost souls. But music needs us as well.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'Brits debate over \\'urban\\' music\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not really comfortable with the word urban. It\\'s a word that\\'s been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music. The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it\\'s wrong. How far are the Brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? It\\'s so far removed that I don\\'t expect them to get it bang on. The music industry isn\\'t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. People don\\'t feel like that\\'s anything to do with us. I don\\'t feel like urban music\\'s just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the Brits acknowledging that there\\'s an urban music scene because it\\'s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. It\\'s not really relevant. If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she\\'s signed to, then so be it. It\\'s got nothing to do with what\\'s really going on.\\n\\n\\n\\nUrban as a genre is very broad. If you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop, R&B, garage and into that obviously comes soul. Joss Stone is a soul artist. Her first album was called The Soul Sessions. So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoots of all of those. Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that she\\'s a UK artist. What has really captured everybody\\'s imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good - I think that\\'s what\\'s done it.\\n\\nThe award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV Base.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think Joss was not a worthy winner. She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. The fact that she\\'s from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she\\'s literally rural. The great thing about urban music is that there\\'s a big range. If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain, I think that\\'s where you can call it urban - that\\'s where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from. Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn\\'t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. It has to come across as real. That\\'s the only cut-off point we have here and that\\'s the only way by which we judge people.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural Britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community, I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. Race doesn\\'t make a difference if everyone is included. Out of all the awards dished out yesterday, I\\'m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.\\n\\n\\n\\nA type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.\\n\\nShe might not be urban, but when did R&B become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? R&B stands for Rhythm And Blues, remember!\\n\\nThat Joss Stone is rubbish is certain. If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (I think probably should include Hip-Hop, Soul & Funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the Streets, although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claim\\n\\nShe definitely deserved to win a prize, Joss Stone\\'s albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. This whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren\\'t nominated or didn\\'t win. I cant see why people can\\'t just congratulate her for the talent that she is.\\n\\nShe did deserve it, but I agree with the comments about urban music. Its a stupid phrase, and particularly British. In the states they tend to use hip hop and R&B, if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what I\\'m talking about. Very strange.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in a name? A rose by any other name etc... If people want to call it urban, why not? If we really analysed it, the term \\'dance music\\' is misleading because it doesn\\'t describe everything you can dance to.\\n\\nWhilst I agree that the term \\'urban\\' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won. \\'Urban\\' to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities - I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties I\\'ve been to. Good luck to Joss Stone, let\\'s celebrate her victory - let\\'s also question why, with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia, Lemar, Kanye West, Dizzee Rascal, Alicia Keys and Outkast - we didn\\'t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.\\n\\nSo, what you\\'re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn\\'t black. And, if it is, then they shouldn\\'t be acknowledged for it even if they\\'re pretty dam good at it? She\\'s 17, has an amazing voice, and won. Good on her. Oh, but she\\'s not \"black\" well, let\\'s make her feel real bad about it then. How dare she! Though hang on, didn\\'t the so-called \\'public\\' vote on this one?\\n\\nThis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what \"Jazz\" was. The media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling \"Jazz\", much to the chagrin of the artists. It would mean that \"blues\" would be put in the same mould as \"bebop\", \"cool\" and \"ragtime\", all very different styles at that time. Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. And so what of \"Urban\" music? In truth it\\'s a lazy term to categorise music that you don\\'t really understand. Soul and garage are worlds apart musically (Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam?), but no doubt have their connections. If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.\\n\\nI demand a prize for rural music! Sucks to the cities- it\\'s way better out here. We have hay, for one thing.\\n\\nExcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely? I dont understand the point that Ty is making. If Lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than Joss\\' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i\\'m black too)\\n\\nHow can she be \"urban\" if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside? Nonsense.\\n\\nI love Joss to bits and don\\'t care what her branding is - it\\'s amazing music, full stop. Stop puting it all in brackets and let\\'s just call it music, and let\\'s especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.\\n\\nSurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the USA could sing country music. If that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style?\\n\\nThe term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards. The very term \\'Music of Black Origin\\' has confused and offended many people. This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards. It appears that the use of \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. The term \\'urban\\' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first \\'black\\' or \\'white\\' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. The result is now a redundant new debate as to what \\'urban\\' also means. Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/RnB and Hip-Hop, one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with \\'Crunk\\'.\\n\\nUrban is just a word that\\'s come about recently to describe \"black\" music that\\'s become popular now. The word wasn\\'t even in use, or common use five of six years ago. It\\'s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.\\n\\nI\\'m in a band that has been called \"urban\", and I despise the label. I\\'d hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that\\'s all it is. Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider \\'music of black origin\\', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. Look at all the TV broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some \\'urban\\' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. Ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.\\n\\nAs a black man, I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. Black people should lead the music they invented . We should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? Same thing, with Streets, Amy Winehouse, etc. Who\\'s ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson.. They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos , but why not Brits????\\n\\nSo what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards. Her music is great soul and surely that is under the \\'Urban\\' banner? What if The Streets had won? Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white... It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.\\n\\nUrban is PC version for saying black music. I\\'m not doubting Ms Stone\\'s talent, but why didn\\'t Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit? This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thing.\\n\\nRefreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comments on any topic these days. More power to you, people! You have said it: there is music you like and music you don\\'t like - who cares what label you put on it?\\n\\nThat entire category was a mess. How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone? Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof. She should have been nominated for Best British R & B act. Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but I don\\'t think it was very \\'urban\\' of her to sing angels with Robbie Williams.\\n\\nUrban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? Well doesn\\'t that include rock? Music made in the inner cities? Well almost all bands end up making music in London/Manchester etc. And doesn\\'t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? It doesn\\'t make any sense.\\n\\nWhy does music have to be put into a genre? It\\'s music, you like it or you don\\'t. Simple as that.\\n\\nI play in a heavy metal band. We are urban music as far as I\\'m concerned. We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; It therefore directly shapes what we write musically.\\n\\n\"Urban\" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. Why it needed a rebrand I don\\'t know as the name is misleading. Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term \"urban\" yet as they\\'re a white rock band they won\\'t be described as such.\\n\\nJoss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the Brit? All this \"urban\" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.\\n\\nYeah, she deserved it. She is talented. Urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. There\\'s only two kinds of music: good and bad.\\n',\n",

Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. \"The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix\\'s house,\" said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation. The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. Now the City of Seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 February for the home to be moved. Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.\\n\\n\"We never said, \\'You can own this property,\\'\" said John Franklin, chief of its operations department. \"From our perspective, it was a temporary situation. We have not threatened to demolish the house. We\\'ve simply asked that they have to move it.\" Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle\\'s central district, where Hendrix grew up. Janie Hendrix, the guitarist\\'s stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him. \"That\\'s something my father really wanted to see,\" she said. \"It would be nice if we didn\\'t have to fight for everything to get it.\" Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time. He died of drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27.\\n',\n",

In the second, Ms Love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone. She must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend Narcotics Anonymous and pay a fine. The ex-Hole singer\\'s lawyer Howard Weitzman said Ms Love had \"turned her life around\" and she was \"clean and sober\".\\n\\nThe assault charge stemmed from April 2004, when Ms Love found musician Kristin King in her boyfriend\\'s home. Ms King said the singer \"threw the bottle at the left side of my face\" in an \"angry, vicious and erratic\" attack. Ms Love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. Judge Rand Rubin said she must:\\n\\n- Spend three years on probation \\n - Have one year\\'s anger management counselling \\n - Have one year\\'s drug rehabilitation \\n - Do 100 hours community service \\n - Pay $1,000 (£535) fine \\n - Have random drug tests \\n - Go to three Narcotics Anonymous meetings per week\\n\\nIn the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault. That offence stemmed from October 2003, when she suffered an overdose after breaking a window at her boyfriend\\'s home. In a separate case relating to the same incident, Ms Love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates. In another case last October, she pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for hitting a man on the head with a microphone stand at a New York City nightclub. Last month her lawyers said she had won back custody of Frances Bean, her 12-year-old daughter with former Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. The girl was removed from her care following her double arrest in October 2003. Cobain committed suicide in 1994.\\n',\n",
              " 'Rapper Kanye West\\'s shrewd soul\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002. The resulting song, Through the Wire, became West\\'s first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially. West, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his Chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers Run DMC.\\n\\nHip-hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark. \"I feel like a lot of the soul that\\'s in those old records that I sample is in me,\" he said. \"So when I hear them and I put them with the drums and I bring them to the new millennium, it\\'s just like God\\'s doing that. I\\'m one with them records right there. It\\'s a blessing.\"\\n\\nLeaving his Chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - West began his music career co-producing songs for artists Mase and the Madd Rapper. This drew the attention of superstar rapper Jay-Z, who signed West up to his Roc-A-Fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. West\\'s work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles Takeover and Izzo (HOVA) on Jay-Z\\'s own 2001 album Blueprint. Incorporating samples of Five to One by The Doors and the Jackson Five\\'s I Want You Back respectively, the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop.\\n\\nAs their success attracted further production work for Jay-Z (\\'03 Bonnie & Clyde) and artists such as Ludacris (Stand Up) and Alicia Keys (You Don\\'t Know My Name), West announced plans for a solo album. Driving home from a late-night Los Angeles recording session in October 2002, he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. \"Anytime I hear about any accident my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I\\'m still here,\" he later said. \"That steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it.\"\\n\\nWest\\'s account of the accident sampled Chaka Khan\\'s hit Through the Fire to become the heart of his completed solo album The College Dropout. Released last year, it was by turns smooth, humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns, girls and jewellery.\\n\\nThrough the Wire was quickly joined in the UK and US charts by Slow Jamz, on which West collaborated with rapper Twista and Ray actor Jamie Foxx. The College Dropout spawned two further UK hits and a string of award nominations. West was shortlisted for 10 Grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year\\'s Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards. Now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, Kanye West is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.\\n',\n",

The pair have been together for more than two years. \"No wedding plans have been set yet,\" said Aguilera\\'s agent Meghan Prophet. Aguilera burst onto the pop scene in 1999, winning a best new artist Grammy in 2000. Her hits include What a Girl Wants, Dirrty and Beautiful. Bratman presented his fiancee with a diamond ring designed by jeweller Stephen Webster on Friday, said Ms Prophet. New York-born Aguilera reached number one in the UK with her debut hit Genie in a Bottle in October 1999. Her early success was cemented by two further Grammys in subsequent years. In 2002, Aguilera won best pop collaboration for the hit track Lady Marmalade with Lil\\' Kim, Maya and Pink, and last year she picked up the award for best female pop vocal performance for Beautiful. Her most recent single, Car Wash, featuring Missy Elliott, reached number four in the UK charts last November.\\n',\n",

Also capitalising on Brits success were the Scissor Sisters whose eponymous album moved three places to number two. U2's latest single Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own took the top spot in the singles chart, ahead of Elvis. The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.\\n\\nElvis' Wooden Heart, which entered the chart at number two, is the sixth in a series of 18 reissues to mark the 70th anniversary of Presley's birth.

              " 'U2\\'s desire to be number one\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. The music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. But such success is down to more than music. They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. They also have to want it. They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. The Beatles had it, the Rolling Stones still have it, REM hold onto it and Queen were it in a catsuit. And U2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list.\\n\\nThey may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.\\n\\nVertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. \"The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" Bono recently said. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: \"We\\'re very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. We don\\'t want to be thought of as a veteran band.\" The band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees.\\n\\n\"This makes them hugely determined and formidable.\" He added: \"They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. \"As such, they\\'ve constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\" The other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, Mr Rees said. \"They do everything in the right way.\" The group were born when Mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils Paul Hewson (Bono, vocals), Adam Clayton (bass), David Evans (The Edge, guitar) and his brother Dick.\\n\\nDick Evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as The Feedback and The Hype before settling on U2.\\n\\nBy 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, Paul McGuinness. \"They were brilliant, but very coarse,\" McGuinness recently said. \"In a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. Only badly.\" They struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as \"pretty damn average\" and \"strange and eerie\" by scouts who saw them live. They released two Ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with Island and their debut album Boy. The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2\\'s aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US. Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year\\'s Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche.\\n\\nHis stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985\\'s Live Aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.\\n\\nIn 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For and With Or Without You. Those songs took the band\\'s epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. The Achtung Baby album in 1991 was followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the White House and Bono\\'s transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. He was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to Aids. Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. But they still want more.\\n',\n",
              " 'Lasting influence of legend Charles\\n\\n\\n\\nHis sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock \\'n\\' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes.\\n\\nCompared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles\\' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the \"devil\\'s\" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.\\n\\nWithout Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David \"Fathead\" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock \\'n\\' roll greats, including I\\'ve Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What\\'d I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael\\'s sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack.\\n\\nHe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson\\'s I Can\\'t Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People.\\n\\nOn it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,\" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. \"I\\'m quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told BBC News Online. \"I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.\"\\n',\n",

R&B star Keys won four awards herself at the Grammy ceremony in Los Angeles. U2, Usher, Norah Jones and Kanye West got three each. West led the race going into the ceremony with 10 nominations.\\n\\nCharles\\' last album, Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets that has sold more than two million copies, was named album of the year and best pop vocal album. His song Here We Go Again with Norah Jones won record of the year and best pop vocal collaboration, while Heaven Help Us All with Gladys Knight picked up best gospel performance. Jones said: \"I\\'m glad he\\'s getting recognised, because of who he is and how much I love him.\" Actor Jamie Foxx - who is nominated for an Oscar for playing Charles in the hit movie Ray - dedicated a rendition of Georgia on My Mind to \"old friends\". Keys, looking to replicate her Grammys success of 2002, when she won five, picked up best R&B song for You Don\\'t Know My Name and best R&B album for The Diary of Alicia Keys. She also shared the award for best R&B vocal performance by a duo or group with Usher for My Boo.\\n\\nUsher\\'s other victories were for best contemporary R&B album for Confessions and best rap/sung collaboration for Yeah!, featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris. Kanye West dominated the rap categories, winning best rap song for Jesus Walks and best rap album for The College Dropout. But in one of the night\\'s biggest shocks, he lost out in the battle to be named best new artist to pop rock act Maroon 5. Vertigo by rock giants U2 won three trophies - best rock song, best short video and best rock vocal performance by a duo or group. One of the other main awards, song of the year, went to US singer-songwriter John Mayer for Daughters. Mayer also won best male pop vocal performance. Britney Spears picked up her first ever Grammy for her song Toxic, which was named best dance recording.\\n\\nRod Stewart also won the first Grammy of his career, getting the best traditional pop album award for Stardust... The Great American Songbook: Volume III. In 2003, Stewart said he was \"astounded\" he had never won a Grammy - but \"they tend not to give it to the British unless you\\'re Sting\". There were few other high-profile British victors this year. Annie Lennox, metal group Motorhead and dance act Basement Jaxx all took home trophies. But Elvis Costello, who had four nominations, and Joss Stone and Franz Ferdinand, who were both up for three awards, got nothing.\\n\\nBeach Boys veteran Brian Wilson was another first-time winner - for best rock instrumental performance. \"It represents triumph and achievement in music that I feel that I deserved, and I\\'m really glad I won,\" he said. A live recording of composer John Adams\\' 11 September tribute, On the Transmigration of Souls, performed by the New York Philharmonic, won three classical prizes.

Fans camped outside Stockholm's Cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. The premiere marks Abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s.

The top five includes Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden and Sex Pistols. Queen, Muse, Manic Street Preachers and The Clash complete the top 10. A mix of heavy metal, punk, glam rock and even dance music makes up the list. Motorhead, Judas Priest and Prodigy are included along with newer acts like The Darkness and Lostprophets.\\n\\nKerrang! editor Ashley Bird said: \"It\\'s amazing to see so many incredible homegrown albums in one list, and without any of the abysmal fashion bands that currently clog up the music scene. \"These are the real opinions of proper rock fans.\"\\n\\nFormed by four teenage friends in the West Midlands in the late 1960s, Black Sabbath are one of Britain\\'s most successful heavy rock bands. Their debut was a UK top 10 hit in 1970 and sold more than a million copies in the US. Osbourne said the band\\'s success in the Kerrang! poll was a triumph for British rock. He said: \"Back then you\\'d hear: \\'If you go to San Francisco, be sure to wear a flower in your hair\\'. \"We lived in Aston, Birmingham.

He was eventually cleared of the charges. Osbourne, who bit off the head of a live bat on stage in 1982, rejoined the band to play the Live Aid charity concert in 1985. After many changes in line-up, the original four members reunited to play live dates in 1997.

Renner warned that unless the industry accepted \"new realties\" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. \"The problem the music industry has got is that they aren\\'t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,\" he stated. \"So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.\"\\n\\nThe music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn). Since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sales fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging.\\n\\n\"You need time,\" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as \"dramatic\" as Mr Renner believed. \"It\\'s quite true that we have severe problems in Germany - but that\\'s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,\" he argued. \"We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. \"I don\\'t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful.\" He did, however, admit that copyright owners have \"partly lost control of their copyright\", due to piracy and copying.\\n\\nBut he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. \"We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,\" he argued. \"At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular. \"It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned.\" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a \"huge problem\". \"There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it\\'s nice, it\\'s fun,\" he added. \"We try to make clear it\\'s not nice and it\\'s not fun - it\\'s endangering the creativity in our country.\"\\n',\n",

He is working with Steve Brown, who wrote the award-winning musical Spend Spend Spend. A spokeswoman said the plans were in the \"very early stages\", with no cast, opening date or theatre announced.\\n\\nA series of workshops have been held in London, and on Wednesday a cast of singers unveiled the musical to a select group of potential investors. Mr Thoday said the idea of turning the film into a musical had been an ambition of his for almost 20 years. It\\'s a Wonderful Life was based on a short story, The Greatest Gift, by Philip van Doren Stern. Mr Thoday managed to buy the rights to the story from Van Doren Stern\\'s family in 1999, following Mr Brown\\'s success with Spend Spend Spend.

The former Libertines singer traded blows with guitarist Patrick Walden. They were separated and bundled off stage before returning to end the set. The show was earlier held up due to audience overcrowding. On Monday Doherty faced blackmail and robbery charges in court, which he denies. He is out on £50,000 bail and the judge agreed to extend his 2200 GMT curfew deadline by two hours so he could play the Brixton gig.\\n\\nBabyshambles, which he formed after his acrimonious departure from the Libertines, played a warm-up show at The Garage, north London, on Monday. On Tuesday, Doherty and his three bandmates were introduced to the crowd by Mick Jones, the former Clash guitarist who produced the Libertines\\' second album. Babyshambles took the stage to a frenzied reception at 2200 GMT, launching into their last single, Killamangiro, which reached number eight in December. But the group had to stop during the next song to persuade fans not to push forward and allow security guards to pull people out of the crush. Doherty appealed to fans to calm down, saying: \"There\\'s a few people getting hurt down the front, you\\'ve got to move back.\"\\n\\nThe music resumed minutes later but after several more songs, the singer appeared to accidentally disconnect Walden\\'s guitar, leading the pair to trade kicks and punches. Bouncers stepped in and the band left the stage, but returned after five minutes and finished their 50-minute performance with no further trouble. Doherty, 25, had to be home by midnight to observe the curfew, which is one of the conditions of his bail. On Monday, the judge agreed to allow him to perform on condition that requests for changes to his bail terms were \"not too regular an occurrence\".

Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the Rogers and Hammerstein classic set in the Alpine country. But despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside Austria.\\n\\nThe film was never shown in any cinema in Austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. The musical is based on the true story of the von Trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938.\\n\\nSensitivities about Nazism during wartime Austria and issues towards the von Trapp family themselves could explain Austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. Another source of irritation for Austrians is the song Edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. The song was actually an invention by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of Austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. The production is being staged at a Viennese opera house, the Volksoper, beginning on Saturday. Maria, the novice nun who falls in love with Baron von Trapp, will be played by Austro-Australian actress and singer Sandra Pires.\\n\",\n",

The rapper\\'s lawyer Ron Rakosky said: \"The bottom line is, we didn\\'t do anything wrong.\" Mr Rakosky said it was better than C-Murder, real name Corey Miller, \"just sitting there, wasting away\". \"Here\\'s a guy in jail, making constructive use of his time instead of withering away,\" he said. \"He\\'s lost more than three years of his life, locked up for a crime he did not commit.\"\\n\\nBut local group Victims and Citizens Against Crime said he should not be working behind bars. \"He is a suspect in a murder case.

All the important people. \"I guess it\\'s just a television show but we always think it\\'s a bit more.\\' The orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average Oscars show. As well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. But you don\\'t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it\\'s exciting,\" explains Conti. And much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. \"We don\\'t know who the winners will be. So when they say, \\'the winner is\\', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,\" adds Conti.\\n\\nThe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show\\'s producers.\\n\\nThe decision to drown out or \\'kill\\' the offending star with music is relayed from the director\\'s box to the orchestra via Conti\\'s earpiece. \"I don\\'t feel good about it at all. It\\'s not my call though,\" he says. \"When the director says \\'music\\' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. We don\\'t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. \"The person that\\'s been cut off, who\\'s 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it\\'s death time.\" On occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. \"Julia Roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,\" he says. Conti received an Oscar in 1983 for the original score of The Right Stuff. He also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for Gonna Fly Now from Rocky and in 1981 for the title song from For Your Eyes Only.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a moment in the sun,\" he says. \"When people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. \"But there\\'s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they\\'re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.\"\\n\\nThe image of the Oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. Behind the scenes, the key players, such as Conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. \"There\\'s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. I can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.\\n\\n\"I have to communicate with the director. I have a little microphone that\\'s attached to my headset. To open up that microphone, I have a footswitch,\" he explains. Conti\\'s most nerve-wracking moment came during his first Oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. Conti immediately told the show\\'s director: \"I start cursing and screaming, I tell him we\\'re not going to die for this show - you must do something or I\\'m going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we\\'re going to be home in 10 minutes. \"\\'Oh no Bill don\\'t do anything,\" came the response. \"Imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we\\'re playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke.\" The smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. \"No one died, it\\'s not a big story, but it was scary at the time,\" laughs Conti. When the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual Governor\\'s Ball with his family. \"I have a drink and relive the show,\" he says. \"I\\'m not for too much carousing. I go home and unwind. It takes me about a day.\"\\n',\n",

Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too.\" The show\\'s reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.\\n\\n\"I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,\" says 27-year-old Ross. \"Even my grandma can download songs now.

A member of The Game\\'s entourage was reportedly shot outside a radio station where 50 Cent was being interviewed. But the pair shook hands as they handed over money to music projects for New York\\'s deprived areas on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor, told a news conference: \"I want to apologise. I\\'m almost ashamed to have participated in the things that went on over the last few weeks.\" Chart-topper 50 Cent, real name Curtis Jackson, said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the Notorious BIG in 1997, who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes. \"We\\'re here today to show that people can rise above the most difficult circumstances and together we can put negativity behind us,\" 50 Cent said.\\n\\n\"A lot of people don\\'t want to see it happen, but we\\'re responding to the two most important groups - our family and our fans.\" The Boys Choir of Harlem got a cheque for $150,000 (£77,800) from 50 Cent, while The Game handed over $103,500 (£53,400). The Game also made a contribution to the Compton schools music programme. 50 Cent announced he has launched the G-Unity Foundation \"to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives\".\\n\\n\"I realised that if I\\'m going to be effective at that, I have to overcome some of my own,\" he said. \"Game and I need to set an example in the community.\" 50 Cent is no stranger to feuds, with rapper Ja Rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs. On his latest album, released earlier this month, he turned his attentions to Fat Joe and Nas, who have both worked with Ja Rule.

US acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the UK for promotional purposes.\\n\\nNigel McCune from the Musicians\\' Union said British musicians are \"disadvantaged\" compared to their US counterparts. A sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. \"If you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,\" says Mr McCune.\\n\\n\"The US is the world\\'s biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,\" says Mr McCune. \"The current situation is preventing British acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the US,\" he added.\\n\\nThe Musicians\\' Union stance is being endorsed by the Music Managers\\' Forum (MMF), who say British artists face \"an uphill struggle\" to succeed in the US, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical.

It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year.\\n\\nLast year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man.\\n\\n\"There isn\\'t anything coming in to replace (the funds),\" said The Libertine\\'s executive producer Marc Samuelson. \"We are in a hiatus.\" Films with \"medium\" budgets of up to £9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK.\\n\\n\"The drop was expected as there was no way 2003\\'s record level of production could be bettered,\" the council\\'s spokesperson said. \"The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements.\" It was \"too early\" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.\\n',\n",

Born in 1922 to poor working-class Jewish immigrants from Romania, Stan Lieberman, got a job in Timely Publications, a company owned by a relative. He was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. For more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. Words of more than two syllables were discouraged. Characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. So embarrassed was Lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. He assumed the \"dumb name\", Stan Lee, now legally adopted.\\n\\nBy the time he was 40, Lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. His British-born wife, Joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. After a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, Timely needed to respond.\\n\\nLee\\'s answer, in 1961, was the Fantastic Four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. They were to change Lee\\'s life, and the comics industry, forever. Lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. They would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. The fan letters poured in. Without immediately knowing it, Stan Lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. His Marvel universe spawned the new title of Marvel Comics. Soon after, nerdy Peter Parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of New York\\'s skyscrapers. Spider-Man was born. He was to become an icon of modern popular culture. Spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. At last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. And the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\\n\\n\"Just because he\\'s a hero and has super powers doesn\\'t mean he doesn\\'t have problems,\" Stan Lee told the BBC. The Incredible Hulk, The Mighty Thor, Iron Man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. Radically, Lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. Jack Kirby, Frank Miller, John Romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. Other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. Daredevil was blind, Black Panther was black and Silver Surfer pondered the state of humanity. Lee\\'s influence remains. Some years ago the Marvel hero, Northstar, came out of the closet. In its heyday, Marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. Until he retired from editing in 1971, Stan Lee wrote all the copy for Marvel\\'s covers.\\n\\nIn 1999, his Stan Lee Media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. Lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. In 2001 though, he started a new company entitled POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. His latest project is a superhero based on a real person - Jay J Armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. But his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with X-Men, The Hulk and Daredevil have all been turned into Hollywood action movies in the last five years. But Spider-Man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before DVD and merchandise sales are counted. It seems Stan Lee is as indestructible as his heroes.\\n',\n",
              " 'Bangkok film festival battles on\\n\\n\\n\\nThe festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. Apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"When the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival\\'s executive director, Craig Prater. \"The decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\\n\\n\"Our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"But we feel like we\\'ve turned a page. We\\'ve acknowledged our position, and now it\\'s business as usual.\"\\n\\nMr Prater\\'s sentiments were echoed by Christine Rush, director of the festival\\'s sister event, the Bangkok Film Market. \"We have been careful to be respectful of the Thai nation\\'s recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\\n\\n\"However, the nation\\'s recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"We are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. Given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. However, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.\\n\\nThe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such Oscar hopefuls as Ray Charles biopic Ray and Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake. That said, the absence of Thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.\\n\\nOn a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. Problems securing air transport, the clash with last Sunday\\'s Golden Globes ceremony in Los Angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.\\n\\nBut the festival has still attracted such Hollywood directors as Oliver Stone and Joel Schumacher, alongside such screen stars as Michael Douglas, Jeremy Irons and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Irons, whose film Being Julia is in competition for the festival\\'s Golden Kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after December\\'s catastrophe. \"I questioned whether I should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the British actor said. \"I thought it might be in rather bad taste. But then I spoke to the organisers and I was encouraged to let life go on. \"Now I\\'ve come here I\\'m very glad. What impresses me about Thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the West,\" he continued. \"Basically I was invited here by Thailand. If they still want you to come, you should.\"\\n\\nNow in its third year, Bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. And while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Pusan in South Korea, Mr Prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"It\\'s grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"We\\'ve had some bumps in the road, but that\\'s only because the festival is still a baby. \"I have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top Asian film festival in the world.\" The Golden Kinnarees will be awarded on Friday. The festival itself runs until 24 January.\\n',\n",

              " 'How the Academy Awards flourished\\n\\n?\\n\\nHOW IT ALL STARTED The first Academy Awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.\\n\\nJust 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.\\n\\nThe first film to win was Wings, which starred Clara Bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. For the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the Los Angeles Times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. As a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. WHEN AND WHERE The tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.\\n\\nThe ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous Grauman\\'s Chinese Theatre the first to host the expanded event. Other venues included the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the Shrine Auditorium. They are now held at the Kodak Theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. Until 1954 they were held on a Thursday, then swapped around from Monday to Wednesday before Sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from May to April to March and now its current month of February. The first televised ceremony was in 1953, with Bob Hope as the MC. WHO WAS OSCAR? There is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as Oscar.\\n\\nOne popular story is that Academy librarian Margaret Herrick said the statue looked like her uncle Oscar. A journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.\\n\\nThe first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist Sidney Skolsky used it to describe Katherine Hepburn\\'s first best actress win in 1934. The Academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. The trophy was designed by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons. Since its inception 2,530 Oscars have been handed out. In support of the war effort, the Academy handed out plaster Oscar statuettes during WWII. After the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. Fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. Winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. WHO SITS IN JUDGEMENT? The Academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. Douglas Fairbanks Sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. There are now 5,700 members of the Academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. Some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the Academy, receipt of an Academy Award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. THE STARS WHO LEFT EMPTY-HANDED While many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the Academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.\\n\\nAmong the overlooked films were Hobson\\'s Choice, Dirty Harry, The 39 Steps, The Searchers and King Kong. Actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included Al Jolson in the Jazz Singer (1927), Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1944), Gene Kelly in Singing in the Rain (1952) and Henry Fonda in 12 Angry Men (1957). Alfred Hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. His enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. THE SHOW ALWAYS GOES ON Not even war has halted the glittering Hollywood event. There were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in Iraq, but as it didn\\'t stop during World War II or the Vietnam war.\\n\\nDocumentary winner Michael Moore ensured nobody forgot about the Iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the American invasion. The ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. The ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. Los Angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. The death of Martin Luther King saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. CONTROVERSIES AND OTHER GAFFES Three people have refused Oscars, including actor George C Scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". Writer Dudley Nichols refused his Academy Award in 1935 for his screenplay for The Insider because the Writers\\' Guild was striking at the time. Marlon Brando turned down his best actor Oscar for The Godfather in 1973 in protest as Hollywood\\'s apparent discrimination against Native American people. He sent along a woman called Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his award. She was later revealed to be Native American actress Maria Cruz.\\n\\nThe following year Robert Opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. The TV network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. Opal was murdered in 1979. Frank Capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, Frank\" to which Frank Capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant Frank Lloyd had won for Cavalcade.\\n\\nCapra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for It Happened One Night.\\n',\n",

The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year.\\n\\nAround 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. \"A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans\\' demand for great music,\" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher\\'s Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004.\\n\\nThe growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004.\\n\\nHowever, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands also saw a decline. \"On the positive side digital sales are booming,\" said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). \"However, commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. \"The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts.\" \"The main choice today\\'s music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally,\" added Mr Jameson.\\n',\n",

It is also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who told BBC News 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to Academy voters. \"It was an extraordinary time making the film and I can\\'t believe what has happened this morning,\" she said. \"I hope it just shows Mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is. \"We are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way.\" Leigh, who had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy, told BBC News 24 the latest success was \"amazing\". He said: \"We hoped that Imelda Staunton would get a nomination but I never expected to get director and screenplay. It\\'s just absolutely wonderful.\\n\\n\"I think people are aware that it\\'s about life - and I hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people.\" Winslet said she was \"ecstatic\" about the fourth nomination of her career. \"Being nominated means so much to me. To be nominated for a film that was released a while ago, I feel so honoured and overwhelmed,\" she said. John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said it was \"extremely heartening\" to see British filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage. \"Britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why National Lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy.\" Among a total of 24 British nominees, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart are up for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie.\\n\\nCinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, is also up for The Phantom of the Opera.

The film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. Plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance, making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. Her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of Bogota at the Ruben Di Pietro theatre academy. She has already received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with Academy Awards, instead recognising quirkier, low-budget films. And at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival the jury could not choose between her and Charlize Theron's Oscar winning performance in Monster so gave them a tied award. Sandino Moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment. But she is taking her time committing to her next project, hoping to land a strong Spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors Pedro Almodovar or Alejandro Amenabar.\\n\",\n",
              " 'Bening makes awards breakthrough\\n\\n\\n\\nBening, who was born in Texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood\\'s favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening\\'s role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999\\'s American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank\\'s leading role in Boys Don\\'t Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988\\'s The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy.\\n\\nFollowing a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening\\'s breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award.\\n\\nHowever the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood\\'s greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations.\\n\\nBugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening\\'s career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas\\' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a \"fiery\" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare\\'s Richard III.\\n\\nBening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes\\' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.\\n',\n",
              " 'Oscars steer clear of controversy\\n\\n\\n\\nIf best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore\\'s Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ. Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (£196m) in the US alone. But this year\\'s Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the \\'minor\\' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.\\n\\nFahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d\\'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004.\\n\\nMoore\\'s caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors\\' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore\\'s film does not sit well with the Academy. \"If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn\\'t really fit in to that category. \"They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren\\'t too contentious,\" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" Moore\\'s film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"I think it\\'s more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.\\n\\nThe problem with Mel Gibson\\'s film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language.\\n\\n\"Hollywood doesn\\'t tend to like foreign-language films - no-one\\'s ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it\\'s a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" Another \\'contentious\\' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.\\n\\nIndependent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its \\'super size\\' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress.\\n\\nThe film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: \"It\\'s a political film, but it\\'s quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It\\'s a very accessible film, and it doesn\\'t beat you over the head with its views. \"While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it\\'s a very likeable film - means it\\'s won through on charm.\" Dam\\'s pick at this year\\'s Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese\\'s biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.\\n',\n",

Lawyers for Mr Fawcett and Mr McDonald denied that the pair were involved in the chase. Kidman sought the \"apprehended violence\" orders - normally used in Australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents - after being advised to do so by local police. \"Nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that,\" said Kidman\\'s publicist Wendy Day. \"However, these are specific actions against two individuals who, over a period of time, have caused her to feel threatened, intimidated and unable to leave her home without fearing for her safety.\" Magistrate Lee Gilmore, who issued the restraining order at Waverley Local Court in Sydney, said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour. \"Miss Kidman says she\\'s willing to put up with some of it, but it\\'s gone beyond that,\" she said. \"I do believe the allegation in relation to the driving is a serious issue.\"\\n',\n",

The festival praises him for his \"sensational start\" with roles in My Beautiful Launderette and costume classic A Room With A View, and a \"great number of celebrated roles\" in subsequent productions. Japan\\'s oldest film studio will also be honoured along with Day-Lewis. Shochiku film studios, which was founded 110 years ago, will become the first cinematic institution to receive the Berlinale Camera award. Famous Japanese directors including Akira Kurosawa have had films produced at the studio.\\n',\n",
              " 'US composer recreates Bach score\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 1728 composition, called Wedding Cantata BWV 216, was found among the papers of Japanese pianist Chieko Hara, who died in Japan in 2001 aged 86. The work, written for the wedding of a daughter of a German customs official, was missing for 80 years. Joshua Rifkin - a composer and leading interpreter of Bach - has recreated the missing instrumental parts.\\n\\nHe said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata lie in rest. \"Maybe a fragment should stay a fragment,\" said Rifkin. \"Then I thought of palaeontologists, from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur. This is my dinosaur.\" The eight rediscovered pages consist of vocal pieces in German for soprano and alto, with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes. The instrumental parts were entirely lost except for two recycled movements, a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in Bach\\'s work. Rifkin likened the challenge to a \"musical Rubik\\'s cube\". \"I could not reconstruct what Bach wrote but I could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like,\" he said. \"It sounds like Bach\\'s music, but the listener should not know which part is Bach\\'s and which part is mine.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'Applegate\\'s Charity show closes\\n\\n\\n\\nStar Christina Applegate had to pull out of pre-Broadway performances earlier this month with a broken foot. Producer Barry Weissler said he was \"deeply proud\" of the show, but said the decision to close it was \"painful but fiscally responsible\". Applegate, who starred in TV comedy Married With Children, had been hoping to make her Broadway debut in the show. The 33-year-old injured herself while performing in Chicago, and had been hoping to recover in time for its official New York opening on 21 April. She had received mixed reviews for performances in Minneapolis and Chicago. Previews of the $7.5m (£4m) show were due to begin on 4 April. Sweet Charity tells the story of Charity Hope Valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man. It was first performed on Broadway in 1966 with Gwen Verdon in the title role, while Shirley MacLaine starred in the 1969 film version.\\n',\n",

A tour bus used by Charles and his entourage over the years will also be on permanent display. It is hoped the museum will be ready for visitors in late 2007.\\n\\nMr Digney said the recording studio and offices had been used by Charles for many years, and was where he recorded much of his last album, Genius Loves Company. It is hoped the museum will also house an education centre. The building had been declared a historic landmark by the city of Los Angeles just before Charles\\' death in June 2004 at the age of 73. Following his death, Charles won eight Grammy Awards, including album of the year for Genius Loves Company, a collection of duets.\\n',\n",

Stories about the state of her marriage to Kevin Federline and rumours about a pregnancy have recently appeared. But the chart-topping singer\\'s letter did not shed any further light on those stories. In February, Spears clashed with Us Weekly for publishing pictures of her honeymoon in Fiji without permission. The couple, who married in Los Angeles last September, claimed staff took photographs of them which were later sold.\\n\\nThey said they allowed the pictures to be taken after they were assured they would only be used for a private scrapbook, which they later received as a souvenir. Us magazine was unrepentant about their decision to publish, saying: \"Britney should start her own magazine if she\\'d like to dictate her own coverage.\" \"Coming from a celebrity who sold pictures of both her wedding and her stepdaughter, it\\'s unlikely the issue here is privacy,\" they added.

Teenage soul singer Joss Stone is a new entry on a list of Britain's young music millionaires with £5m.\\n\\nMs Craymer, who developed Mamma Mia! with playwright Catherine Johnson and members of Abba, is at number 31 on the music rich list. But taking the top spot for a second year is former record label boss Clive Calder, whose wealth has risen to £1.3bn. Mr Calder is the man behind acts including Britney Spears. He made his fortune by selling his independent label Zomba to record giant BMG. Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney is second on the list with £800m - up £40m on last year. Andrew Lloyd-Webber's wealth rose an estimated £300m on last year, to £700m, while theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh's fortune rose from £340m to £400m.\\n\\nHis recent hits have included the West End show Mary Poppins.

              " 'Casino Royale is next Bond movie\\n\\n\\n\\nIt will be the 21st James Bond film to hit the big screen, and speculation has been rife over who will play the lead. Casino Royale was turned into a spoof spy movie by John Huston in 1967, with David Niven in the lead role. Pierce Brosnan led the past four Bond films but said producers axed him after offering him the chance to return. Among the favourites to take over the coveted role are Scottish actor Dougray Scott, Oscar nominee Clive Owen and Australian star Hugh Jackman. Producers say no decision has yet been made on who will become the seventh actor, including Niven, to play Bond on film. Kill Bill director Quentin Tarantino had talked of wanting to take on the Casino Royale project, and said he had spoken to Brosnan about it.\\n\\nShooting on Casino Royale is expected to begin once Campbell has finished work on The Legend of Zorro, a sequel to The Mask of Zorro, starring Catherine Zeta Jones and Antonio Banderas. Producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson expect the film to be released in 2006.\\n\\nThe script will once again be developed by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade who have both worked on two previous Bond movies. Fleming\\'s book saw the introduction of Bond pitted against a Russian spy in a game of baccarat. Simultaneously, a woman arrives on the scene to take his eye off the game. The novel is one of Fleming\\'s most violent and sadistic stories, with 007 suffering a savage beating from his nemesis Le Chiffre. In addition to the 1967 film, it was also adapted for television in 1954 with actor Barry Nelson as an Americanised \"Jimmy\" Bond. MGM Vice Chairman Chris McGurk said: \"Martin (Campbell) is an incredibly exciting film-maker. Goldeneye was a wonderful movie and helped reinvigorate the Bond franchise. We\\'re thrilled to have him back to direct the newest Bond.\" New Zealand-born Campbell moved to the UK in 1966 and directed TV series such as The Professionals, Minder and Bergerac. His film credits include Edge of Darkness, Vertical Limit and Beyond Borders, which starred Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen.\\n',\n",

Festival director Dieter Kosslick says this strong showing signals \"a new consciousness for European films\". \"They\\'re on an incredible winning streak,\" he told the Reuters agency. \"This isn\\'t to say there aren\\'t any good American films,\" he continued. \"It\\'s just that there are more good European films.\"\\n\\nHowever, Mr Kosslick refused to accept that widespread opposition to the Iraq war had turned audiences against Hollywood imports. \"There is no anti-American mood,\" he said. Some 350 films will be screened at this year\\'s festival, with a further 300 shown at the European Film Market that runs alongside it. More than a dozen celebrities are scheduled to attend, among them Will Smith, Kevin Spacey and Keanu Reeves. But Mr Kosslick says more would be coming had the Academy Awards not been brought forward to 27 February. \"I\\'m not worried that we won\\'t be able to fill the red carpet with stars,\" he said, though he admitted the festival may be moved to January next year to avoid a similar clash.

Ray has been nominated in six Oscar categories including best film and best actor for Jamie Foxx. The film recounts the life of blues singer Ray Charles, who died in 2004. In its first week on home entertainment release the film was the number one selling DVD, with the limited edition version coming in at number 11. Sony horror film The Grudge, starring Michelle Gellar, was the US' second best-selling DVD, with Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere's romantic comedy Shall We Dance? at number three. Foxx's critically acclaimed performance as Ray has already earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor, as well as a prestigious Golden Globe. Ray director Taylor Hackford, responsible for the classic 1982 film An Officer and a Gentleman, has also received an Oscar nomination in the best director category.

The research was carried out jointly by the UK Film Council and industry training body Skillset. It also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children.\\n\\nThe study, which claims to be the most in-depth so far conducted, found 60% of women in the film industry hold degrees, compared with 39% of men. Whilst 17% of men in the industry had no qualifications, this was true for only five per cent of women. In the lower salary bracket, 35% of women earn less than £20,000 a year, compared to only 18% of men. The research found very few women worked in the camera, sound, electrical and construction departments, but they made up a majority of those working in make-up and hairdressing.\\n\\nUK Film Council chief executive John Woodward said: \"Whilst the UK has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry.\" \"Developing the film production workforce must be underpinned with a commitment to diversity as well as training.\" The workforce is largely focused around London, with 78% in the industry based in the capital and the south east of England. The industry depends heavily on word of mouth, with 81% being recruited in that way. In total, only five percent of the workforce is made up of ethnic minorities, although in London the figure rises to 24%.

These include best film, best director and best actress shortlist for Imelda Staunton who plays the eponymous character. The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics\\' Circle on Wednesday night.\\n\\nThe Baftas has a tradition of honouring British cinema, and this year Vera Drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise. Empire magazine\\'s reviews editor Dan Jolin said the film had \"a very good chance\" of doing well on Saturday, predicting that it would collect five or six awards. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to do a Lord of the Rings-style sweep, but Imelda Staunton is a shoo-in for best actress,\" he said.\\n\\n\"A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland.\" Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies. Strong Oscar contenders Million Dollar Baby and Sideways did not figure in the Bafta nominations, giving Vera Drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizes.\\n\\n\"There is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back. Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.\"\\n\\n\"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year\\'s Baftas\", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet. Mr Jolin also tipped Phil Davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in Vera Drake but felt that Heather Craney could be outdone by Kate Winslet or Natalie Portman in the supporting actress category. \"If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas,\" he said.\\n\\nThe Guardian\\'s film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there \"might well be\" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night. \"I hope that Bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film. If Bafta can\\'t do so, what hope is there?\" he said. Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh\\'s \"masterpiece\" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man\\'s Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy. \"I will be cheering if Vera Drake wins a whole host of awards,\" he added.\\n',\n",
              " 'Roundabout continues nostalgia trip\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show Thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of E Nesbit\\'s Five Children and It, previously filmed by the BBC in 1991. He-Man and Transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. With screen versions of The A-Team, The Dukes of Hazzard and even Blake\\'s Seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. But some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. The new version of The Magic Roundabout, which will be released as Sprung! in the US, replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s TV show with polished, computer-generated animation.\\n\\nIn a similar fashion, the 2004 Thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original\\'s puppets and models. The films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. Pop stars Robbie Williams and Kylie Minogue provide voices in The Magic Roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band Busted performed the Thunderbirds theme song. But while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. \"This CG-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion Roundabout a cult hit,\" writes Stella Papamichael on the BBC Movies site.\\n\\nAnd the recent puppet comedy Team America: World Police was in part provoked by its directors\\' outrage that Gerry Anderson\\'s Thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. Dan Jolin, reviews editor of Empire magazine, says classic children\\'s TV shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.\\n\\n\"I can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. \"But I think it\\'s backfiring. What\\'s next - The Clangers on some distant planet, with some giant CGI Soup Dragons chasing after them?\" Despite Thunderbirds\\' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (£22m) but only recouped $21m (£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. It can therefore be only a matter of time before some other TV favourites receive the Hollywood treatment.\\n\\nAfter the success of Garfield: The Movie, Britain\\'s shabby tabby\\n\\nsurely deserves his own film vehicle. With only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, Professor Yaffle and the Mice of the Marvellous Mechanical Mouse Organ.\\n\\nFurry recyclers\\n\\nhave already had one big-screen outing - 1977\\'s Wombling Free. But with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. Advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the BBC\\'s supernatural comedy\\n\\n. And the success of Pirates of the Caribbean must surely herald a comeback for TV\\'s most popular cartoon buccaneer,\\n\\n. It might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.\\n\\nThe Magic Roundabout is out in the UK on 11 February.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow about bringing Catweazle to the big screen? He could give Gandalf a run for his money!\\n\\nThundercats!! I loved it. Should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!\\n\\nGet your hands off the Clangers! Is nothing sacred?\\n\\nMake a movie version of the Banana splits!\\n\\nWhat about Keanu Reeves and Richard Gere in a remake of The Wooden Tops? Or perhaps Robbie Williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of Andy Pandy.\\n\\nYou forgot to mention the grearest of them all, Danger Mouse! But then again, it couldn\\'t be better than the original series, could it?\\n\\nIt\\'s always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal Thunderbirds movie (and the song!) I think I\\'ve been completely put off. Just leave these classics alone as good memories.\\n\\nI think remakes are a good idea. As the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. I believe this is the whole reason \"retro\" has become so popular. As long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. Personally i\\'d like to see cartoons such as Transformers, Thundercats and M.A.S.K. get full Hollywood remakes.\\n\\nLeave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? The thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series I grew up with and the Magic Roundabout will never be the same without the voice of Eric Thompson.\\n\\nLove to see Transformers with real actors and CGI. And make it at least a 15 rating.\\n\\nPart of the reason for the success of such classics as the Magic Roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. They were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. Just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. Dougal never smiled like that! Films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of Disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.\\n\\nI have fond memories of Bod (not least of which because I look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. It\\'s got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. Bod would likely be played by Tom Cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.\\n\\nIt\\'s all very well and good remaking these classic TV shows and films with all the latest technology for a \\'new\\' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. It maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as Thunderbirds and Magic Roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. It does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?\\n\\nAll I can say is bring back Danger Mouse, probably the greatest kids\\' show ever. I recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in Danger Mouse that was completely lost on me when I was a child.\\n\\nThere WAS a new Captain Pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. Again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original\\'s cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate. We live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. Seems that the film and TV is doing the same now - it\\'s just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.\\n\\nIt got to be Mr.Benn. The story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! If they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. And who to play the lead role? Well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like Steve Martin. If its going to be an adventure then Johnny Depp playing a role similar to the Pirates Of The Caribbean Character.\\n\\nMuffin the Mule perhaps ? After all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!\\n\\nWhy can\\'t the British film industry try making Gerry Anderson\\'s UFO or Captain Scarlet, or Saphire and Steel, or The Tomorrow People.\\n\\nIn today\\'s media, it seems the past is the future. TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica have new remakes, DJ\\'s are sampling or re-working 70\\'s and 80\\'s music. Even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. Personally, I think it shows that no one has any originality any more! Why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.\\n\\nMary, Mungo and Midge. But of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. Plus would Mary be more of a Vicky Pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block? Yeah but no but I wasn\\'t even there!\\n\\nI\\'d like to see Mr. Benn, with Brad Pitt in the title role. Sean Connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.\\n\\nIt demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today\\'s film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. There are plany of modern children\\'s book that would make excellent films or TV programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?\\n\\nMr. Benn with Rowan Atkinson as the lead.\\n\\nWould have loved to see Dungeons & Dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn\\'t come up to scratch. The only one that isn\\'t to be remade as yet is Thundercats, which I\\'d like to see.\\n\\nI\\'m an expat living in Norway, and I recently went through a period of buying the DVDs of many of my favourite children\\'s programs for my 2 daughters. My dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of Noggin the Nog appear on The Big Screen!! Very Scandinavian...\\n\\nRainbow!\\n\\nI believe that Childrens classics should be left well alone, and I will not be surprised if the Magic Roundabout does not do well at the Box Office, especially since it will be going up against The Spongebob Squarepants movie, popular among children because it\\'s original, witty, and modern. The Magic Roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.\\n\\nHow about classics like Chorlton and the Wheelies, Rentaghost, Terrahawks, Bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!\\n\\nIf a Transformers movie is indeed on the cards then I\\'ll be the first one on Amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. Repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! I don\\'t care! Till then I\\'ll have to make do with the Citreon C4 advert.\\n\\nI\\'d luv to see Willow the Wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late Kenneth Williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. And who remembers Trap Door voiced by the late Willie Rushden, superb children\\'s programme. Could Morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? Or even Jamie and the Magic Torch....hmmmmm, I could go on and on. Danger Mouse? At 34 I\\'m showing my age. :-)\\n\\nNoggin the Nog was one of the best children\\'s programs. The problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach Oliver Postgate\\'s wonderful voices. So in general leave well alone. The originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.\\n\\nJust imagine what could be achieved by using CGI in a remake of Fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, Yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like Fingermouse\\n\\nBob the Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. In the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns, Krusty and Gobo. Will they triumph or will they fail miserably? Find out this Fall.\\n\\nOne puppet show that I personally would love to see made into a live action movie is Joe 90. It would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of Joe\\'s car. Of course, Gerry Anderson\\'s Supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. It was only that Thunderbirds The Movie was targetted as a children\\'t movie that really let it down. After all, the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.\\n\\nIt\\'s only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn\\'t it? I\\'d hate to see Bagpuss with perfect animation - I love that \\'done in a shed\\' clunkiness and you couldn\\'t recreate the magic. Perhaps if the remakes were done in a \\'Look Around You\\' mock-authentic style I might be interested ...\\n\\nChorton And The Wheelies or Jamie And His Magic Torch; that would be mega!\\n\\nThis re-gurgitation of old films and TV shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people\\'s ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. The same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material, Will Young etc. The sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. The fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. Starsky & Hutch) Hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!\\n\\nI pray they never do a remake of Chorlton And The Wheelies. I\\'m only 27 and don\\'t remember the series from when it was on TV, but have the set on DVD and it\\'s a classic. The fact it\\'s so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today\\'s stuff it looks amateurish. Thats the appeal though, it\\'s so innocent (like Chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.\\n',\n",

They emerged from limos at Leicester Square to an uncertain British climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next. But the gods were certainly shining on the thousands of film fans who lined the red carpet to meet their idols. Screaming built up into a crescendo as more and more big name stars appeared. The biggest cheer of the night was reserved for The Aviator star Leonardo DiCaprio, who paused in the chilly February air to sign autographs for the throngs. He said the ear-piercing welcome was \"unlike anything I\\'ve ever encountered.

She said: \"Never in a million years did I think this was going to happen. \"Being here and just being nominated is great, but I hope it means more people will go and see the film as well.\" Rooting for Staunton in the best actress category was Cate Blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn in The Aviator.\\n\\nShivering in a floor-length shimmering Armani dress, the Australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: \"It\\'s tight but I love it.\" Glamour was also brought to the evening by actress Sienna Miller, supermodel Claudia Schiffer - who was supporting her director husband Matthew Vaughn - Troy actress Diane Kruger and star of the TV programme The OC, Micha Barton. Wearing a caramel-coloured floaty frock by the designer Alexander McQueen, Miller told reporters the red carpet experience was \"intense, nerve-wracking and cold\". The younger stars of British film were also represented in the shape of Emma Watson, who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter films.

Keanu Reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an \"exciting\" part of his job. \"It is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,\" he said. Martin Scorsese, whose movie The Aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the UK meant a lot to him. He said: \"I am a great admirer of British cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.\\n\\n\"They give me a new energy when I see the best coming out of England and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. \"To recognise me in this way is a great honour.\" British actor Clive Owen, who has won a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his supporting role in Closer, said it \"meant a lot\" to be at the ceremony.

Friends and family, including actress Ruby Dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the Riverside Church on Saturday. Also present at the service was former US president Bill Clinton and singer Harry Belafonte, who gave the eulogy. \"He would have been a very good president of the United States,\" said Mr Clinton. \"Like most of you here, he gave more to me than I gave to him.\"\\n\\nThe 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in Florida, where he was making a film. Police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. Davis made his acting debut in 1950 in No Way Out starring Sidney Poiter. He frequently collaborated with director Spike Lee, starring in seven Lee films including Jungle Fever, Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X. Attallah Shabazz, the daughter of activist Malcolm X, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by Davis at her father\\'s funeral. \"Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,\" she said, quoting the man she knew as Uncle Ossie. \"Ditto.\" \"Ossie was my hero, and he still is,\" said Aviator star Alan Alda, a family friend for over forty years. \"Ossie was a thing of beauty.\"\\n\\n\"I want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,\" added Burt Reynolds, Davis\\'s co-star in the 90s TV comedy Evening Shade. Before the midday funeral, scores of Harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to Davis. \"It is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought,\" said Belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with Davis for over 60 years. \"But how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did.\"\\n',\n",

The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years.\\n\\nOscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. \"A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beautiful skin,\" he said.\\n\\n\"To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. \"The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,\" he told the newspaper.\\n\\nFox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. \"Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,\" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. \"If in five years\\' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,\" he added. Keith Poulton, a business adviser from Swansea, has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project. \"We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we\\'ve only got two months to do that,\" said Mr Poulton. \"A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an awful lot of time,\" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.\\n',\n",

The film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. McDonald\\'s announced it was to scrap its \"supersized\" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by Spurlock\\'s film.

The psychological drama stars Stellan Skarsgard and foreruns the 1973 film. Schrader was replaced by director Renny Harlin who made a new version of the film which debuted in 2004. The prequel project was originally announced in 2001, with actor Liam Neeson in the lead role and John Frankenheimer as director. However Frankenheimer pulled out in 2002, a month before he died.\\n\\nSkarsgard then replaced Neeson in the role of Father Merrin, made famous by Max Von Sydow in the 1973 film. Principal footage was shot in Morocco and Rome at a reported cost of $32m. However, in August 2003 it emerged that producers Morgan Creek were shelving Schrader's version of the film, having complained it was not scary enough. As well as replacing Schrader with Harlin - the director behind Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger - the producers also changed most of the cast, but Swedish star Skarsgard stayed in the Merrin role. Harlin's film, released in the UK in October 2004, received lukewarm reviews but went on to make over $76m (£40.7m) worldwide. The festival screening will be the first time that Schrader's film has been seen in public. Reports that it will be released either in cinemas or on DVD have yet to be confirmed.

I think it\\'s fair to say it does concern us a bit,\" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year\\'s nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier\\'s Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year\\'s ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board.\\n\\nAnd the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars.\\n\\nThe film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). \"Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,\" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. \"People like to have a vested interest in what they\\'re watching. \"When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you\\'ve got a lot of people with a vested interest.\" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year\\'s nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far.\\n\\nLow-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. The year\\'s biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). Mel Gibson\\'s The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters.\\n\\nBut many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. \"I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,\" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. \"That\\'s the People\\'s Choice Awards.

Buhecha, who made £26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest Bollywood pirates in the UK\" by the sentencing judge. The British Phonographic Industry (BPI) worked for two years on the case.\\n\\nAn operation was launched against Buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. The judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage Buhecha caused to legitimate business\". Fake DVDs were manufactured in Pakistan and Malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by Buhecha, who traded in conterfeit DVDs in 2002 and 2003.\\n\\nIn December 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated DVDs and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. Despite being arrested and bailed, Buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. His home and a lock-up in Cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit DVDs and further faked inlay cards. Buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of Bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of Bollywood classic Mohabbatein. Legitimate Bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". Bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. The BPI welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of Bollywood films.

              " 'US \\'afflicted\\' with awards fatigue\\n\\n\\n\\nBob Strauss, from the LA Daily News, thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. He came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events, which roughly translates a \"celebrity love-in\". This echoed the views of Oscars host and comedian Chris Rock, who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them, calling award shows \"idiotic\". \"As Chris Rock accurately said, they\\'re about celebrity and fashion,\" Mr Strauss said. The recent Grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser, and it seems Oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way.\\n\\nRecently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. But Entertainment Weekly\\'s Dave Karger maintained the Oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster, such as Titanic or Lord of the Rings, was nominated. The near constant flow of US film awards, representing directors, actors and producers\\' guilds, also means \"few surprises\" are left by the time the Oscar ceremony is upon us, he said. A quick scan of the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the Times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the Kodak Theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news, while in the UK bets have closed on the best actor category, with Ray star Jamie Foxx a dead cert to win.\\n\\nScreen International\\'s US editor Mike Goodridge thinks 2004\\'s films have simply not grabbed the public\\'s imagination. \"Film-makers haven\\'t produced films that people adore this year,\" he said. \"They adored Saving Private Ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. \"2004\\'s films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in America that things might not be so rosy after all. \"Audiences don\\'t necessarily want to see darker films such as Million Dollar Baby, Aviator and Finding Neverland, which end with casualty.\" As to whether Rock could pep up the awards, the critics were not hopeful.\\n\\nMr Strauss doubted whether Rock would make an impact, but added: \"I\\'m all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the Oscars.\" Mr Karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but Mike Goodridge thought Rock\\'s humour could prompt America\\'s conservative states to switch off. So despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win?\\n\\n\"Clint Eastwood\\'s Million Dollar Baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat Aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings,\" Mr Karger said. \"Eastwood has it in the bag,\" added Mr Strauss. \"Oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads.\" And Mr Goodridge said best film and director were between Martin Scorsese\\'s Aviator and Million Dollar Baby. Mr Karger, whose favourite film of the year was Mike Leigh\\'s abortion drama Vera Drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. \"I hope this is the year for small films to triumph,\" he said. \"After all, it\\'s still one of the biggest TV events of the year.\"\\n',\n",
              " 'Critics back Aviator for Oscars\\n\\n\\n\\nBut several of those surveyed by the BBC News website think the veteran film-maker will lose the best director prize to Clint Eastwood. Most of the critics tipped Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank to scoop best actor and actress for Ray and Million Dollar Baby respectively. The jury comprised experts and critics from the top UK film publications. The panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to win.\\n\\nAll expect The Aviator to win best film, but many think it will be a close race between Scorsese\\'s Howard Hughes biopic and Eastwood\\'s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby. The other films nominated are wine comedy Sideways, factual drama Finding Neverland, and Ray Charles biopic Ray.\\n\\n\"I\\'m pretty sure this is the year of The Aviator, though my own choice would be Sideways,\" said the Observer\\'s Philip French. \"Sideways should win but it doesn\\'t have a hope,\" said Jamie Graham of Total Film, a position shared by Film 2005 presenter Jonathan Ross. \"The form going in to the Oscars points to The Aviator, but I liked Million Dollar Baby more,\" said Tim Dams, news editor of trade weekly Screen International.\\n\\nFive of the eight critics tipped Scorsese to win best director, with Mr Dams, Heat\\'s Charles Gant and Empire\\'s Angie Errigo plumping for Eastwood. Sideway\\'s Alexander Payne, Ray\\'s Taylor Hackford and British director Mike Leigh - nominated for period drama Vera Drake - are considered outsiders in this category. \"Up until recently I could have sworn Scorsese would get it just for being Scorsese,\" Ms Errigo told the BBC News website. \"But I\\'m beginning to think Eastwood will get it.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'d be very happy for Mike Leigh to win, but I don\\'t think he has any chance,\" said Charles Gant, film editor of Heat. Foxx\\'s portrayal of Ray Charles has already seen him win prizes at the Golden Globes, Baftas and Screen Actors Guild Awards. Mr Dams said this made him \"out-and-out favourite\" to be named best actor on Oscar night. \"Everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didn\\'t win,\" he said. \"If you\\'re a betting man, he\\'s as close as you get to a certainty.\" \"If Paul Giamatti was nominated for Sideways it would be a different game,\" says Total Film\\'s Jamie Graham. \"But Foxx will and should win.\"\\n\\nWith Vera Drake star Imelda Staunton nominated for best actress alongside Kate Winslet, Britain has a good chance of victory - on paper. Jonathan Ross, for one, will be very happy if Winslet wins for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. But while Wendy Ide of The Times still thinks Staunton has a chance, Heat\\'s Charles Gant believes her Bafta win will cut little ice with Academy voters. \"I\\'d like Staunton to win, but her chances are not that great,\" said Mr Gant, who predicted a second Oscar for Hilary Swank.\\n\\n\"I think Swank will win,\" said Mr French. \"Imelda has got as far as she\\'s going to get playing that role.\" Staunton is also the personal choice of Steven Gaydos, executive editor of industry magazine Variety. But while he tipped Swank to win, he predicted it would be a close contest. \"Everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way,\" he told the BBC News website. \"There\\'s not a sense that it\\'s obvious how it\\'s going to go.\" Meanwhile, thousands of people have voted in a BBC Radio Five Live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture Oscar.

McKendry\\'s entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy\\'s headquarters in Beverly Hills. \"I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I\\'ve ever seen,\" says Arnold.\\n\\nSet in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she\\'s on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby\\'s mouth. \"The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can\\'t shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,\" she explains.\\n\\nSince she presented children\\'s TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. \"I\\'m not interested in the publicity. It\\'s not my personality. I\\'m overwhelmed by all the fuss,\" she said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. \"But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I\\'d still be proud of it - even if it hadn\\'t won any.\" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels \"flattered and honoured\". \"We\\'ve all been overwhelmed by the response and can\\'t get it in perspective yet. I\\'m still reeling.\"\\n\\nAnd she won\\'t commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. \"I\\'m just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day.\" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. \"People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn\\'t stop ringing for a week after I got nominated.\" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. \"You\\'re left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much.\" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.\\n',\n",

Moreno is also nominated for best actress at the Oscars. The best first screenplay award went to Joshua Marston for Maria Full of Grace. Scrubs star Zach Braff won the award for best first feature for Garden State, which he wrote, directed and starred in.

I am lucky to be here and lucky to be still working. I\\'ve got a lot of stuff to do yet.\" Hilary Swank picked up her second best actress Oscar for playing a female boxer in Million Dollar Baby, beating stars including Annette Bening, Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton. \"I don\\'t know what I did in this life to deserve this,\" she told the audience. \"I\\'m just a girl from a trailer park who had a dream.\" Morgan Freeman beat actors including Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx and Alan Alda to the prize for best supporting actor. He thanked Eastwood and described the film as \"a labour of love\". This was the fourth nomination of his career but his first win. Backstage, he said: \"A lot of people say you\\'re due - maybe you are, maybe you aren\\'t - it\\'s an accolade.\" Million Dollar Baby\\'s success was the night\\'s biggest surprise after The Aviator seemed to have the advantage until the end of the ceremony.\\n\\nCate Blanchett, who won for playing late screen legend Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, said her award was \"an indescribable surprise and honour\". Of Hepburn, she said: \"The longevity of her career is inspiring to everyone.\" Blanchett also paid tribute to the film\\'s director Martin Scorsese, telling him: \"I hope my son will marry your daughter.\" The Aviator\\'s other awards came for cinematography, film editing, art direction and costume design. And Jamie Foxx, who had two nominations this year, paid tribute to the \"beautiful legacy\" of soul legend Ray Charles, who died last year, and thanked director Taylor Hackford. \"You took a chance, man,\" he said. \"That love for Ray Charles was deep down in the earth somewhere and you opened it up. \"Everybody\\'s drowning in this love. Thank you for taking a chance and thank you for waiting 15 years to get me to do it.\"\\n\\nHe broke down in tears when speaking about being whipped by his grandmother, whom he described as his first acting teacher, when he was young. In other awards, cartoon hit The Incredibles won best animated feature and best sound editing. Bittersweet comedy Sideways won best adapted screenplay while the original screenplay prize went to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Born into Brothels, about the children of prostitutes in Calcutta, was named best documentary, The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film and Finding Neverland got the accolade for best musical score. Spider-Man 2 triumphed in the visual effects category, Ray won best sound mixing and Lemony Snicket\\'s A Series of Unfortunate Events picked up best make-up. Former British TV presenter Andrea Arnold, who hosted children\\'s shows Motormouth and Number 73 in the 1980s, won best short film for Wasp.

That award was won by Al Otro Lado Del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator.

              " 'Jackson film \\'absolute disaster\\'\\n\\n\\n\\nAnn Kite told the court in the Californian town of Santa Maria she was hired to \"crisis manage\" the fallout after the programme had aired in 2003. Jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on Tuesday. Mr Jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. If convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison.\\n\\nMs Kite suggested Jackson\\'s associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser\\'s family after the airing of Martin Bashir\\'s film Living with Michael Jackson. She told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast, a Jackson lawyer had told her the boy\\'s mother would be made to look like a \"crack whore\". Jackson\\'s defence questioned Ms Kite\\'s credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer\\'s team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.\\n\\nMs Kite said she received a phone call on 13 February 2003 from a Jackson associate, Marc Schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the Neverland ranch where they had been staying.\\n\\nMs Kite told the court she had later asked Jackson\\'s lawyer, David LeGrand, what had happened. \"I said, `Don\\'t make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch\\',\" she said. Ms Kite began to work for Mr Jackson in February 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the US and Europe. The documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into Mr Jackson\\'s relationship with the boy. In the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.\\n\\nQuestioned by the prosecution, Ms Kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. Ms Kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against Mr Jackson. The Smoking Gun website publication was \"beyond disaster\", Ms Kite said. Correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.\\n\\nThe judge is studying whether the prosecution\\'s first witness, reporter Martin Bashir, is in contempt of court. The defence protested after Mr Bashir, who interviewed Jackson for the TV documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a California \"shield\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. In the prosecution\\'s opening statement on Monday, Tom Sneddon told the court that Mr Jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. He said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\\n',\n",

The film is being produced by Joel Silver, producer of the Matrix trilogy.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no one better than Joss to adapt the legendary Wonder Woman comic book character created in the 1940s into a dynamic feature film for 21st Century audiences,\" said Silver. \"Wonder Woman was the first great female superhero to emerge from comic books and later inspire millions of fans in her television incarnation... but this groundbreaking heroine has yet to be reinvented for the feature film arena.\" Whedon created the character of Buffy in the screenplay for the 1992 film. He distanced himself from the movie because of the direction it eventually took, and the film bombed. But he did not give up on the Slayer and went on to write and executive produce seven seasons of the cult TV series. He also produced the spin-off Angel series. He is currently directing the film Serenity, based on his short-lived sci-fi series Firefly.\\n']"

closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he saidkapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good ideakapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top  singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fmhe concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonighti think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labelsrather than expecting the government  ie the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government fundsif they can fund football why not fund musicareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cashthe government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into thatas a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goodsi think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorshipyes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the massesthere are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better useas long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked aboutonly if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investmenti think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from therei do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great dealyeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you likethough i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us',\n",

something that someone else has done better beforegive us a breakbest song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but reallylistened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfectionas usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty lowim actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  yearswhat about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbishangels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish musicbest of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after allits alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travestyrubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear fromwhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good showyouve got to be kiddingangels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the britsi think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself thoughbest song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awardsso boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will youngoh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talenti hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance withi agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbiei think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bushangels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groupsrobbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people thinkyes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaningive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisssangels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a centuryno surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come onwhat a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come closewhat a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give upwhy do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for herethe great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nopeno because im not female and im not ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a jokepredictable and laughablethe success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  yearsi am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the listhave radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever willno doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other songit should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music todayyes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winneri am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting musicthe best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie downit just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  ltno offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffini think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dustobviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for itif this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best recorda sad day for musicits not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbiebest song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have becomegranted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for himbest song of the last  years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankfulangels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winnersit would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done robi find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popularive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profitno surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in musicpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heardit absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to comeits an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young thoughalthough it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talentalthough angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means',\n",

              " 'brits debate over urban musicim not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going onurban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop rb garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a yearold from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done itthe award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv basei dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge peoplewhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or awarda type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban lifeshe might not be urban but when did rb become the hip hop tainted thing it is now rb stands for rhythm and blues rememberthat joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul  funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she isshe did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and rb if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strangewhats in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance towhilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an awardso what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes  has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this onethis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the s and s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it representsi demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thingexcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black toohow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsensei love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their coloursurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that stylethe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulrnb and hiphop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunkurban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for itim in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just musicas a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both  times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not britsso what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing elseurban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thingrefreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itthat entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r  b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williamsurban is a nonsense term  music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in londonmanchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sensewhy does music have to be put into a genre its music you like it or you dont simple as thati play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musicallyurban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as suchjoss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignoredyeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless

children and it previously filmed by the bbc in  heman and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stopmotion models of the s tv show with polished computergenerated animationin a similar fashion the  thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cganimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the s stopmotion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies siteand the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinventioni can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think its backfiring whats next  the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance  the film cost m m but only recouped m m  the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatmentafter the success of garfield the movie britains shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle with only  episodes made of the  series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organfurry recyclershave already had one bigscreen outing  s wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbcs supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tvs most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existedthe magic roundabout is out in the uk on  februaryhow about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his moneythundercats i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth backget your hands off the clangers is nothing sacredmake a movie version of the banana splitswhat about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandyyou forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could itits always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think ive been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memoriesi think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and mask get full hollywood remakesleave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompsonlove to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a  ratingpart of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first placei have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film its got all the right material for an american blockbuster  no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or twoits all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideasall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a childthere was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation  this time computer created flatcell like animation  failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world  the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from  years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now  its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something newit got to be mrbenn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean charactermuffin the mule perhaps  after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you knowwhy cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow peoplein todays media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking s and s music even computer games from  years ago are getting modern reworkings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alonemary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasnt even thereid like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop ownerit demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastmr benn with rowan atkinson as the leadwould have loved to see dungeons  dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to seeim an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my  daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavianrainbowi believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years agohow about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and onif a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c advertid luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at  im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the storyjust imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermousebob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fallone puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe  it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car of course gerry andersons supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselvesits only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation  i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be megathis regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry  it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the  the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm the fact that they will be forgotten in  months time is irrelevant eg starsky  hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying iti pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only  and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classic the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it',\n",

wasnt something i wanted to do any more ms trew who runs a dance school in gateshead admitted it would be very difficult to reverse the trend and said many young ballet dancers were no longer willing

evolving a spokeswoman for the rad said it is our responsibility to reignite the passion and nurture young dancers for the longterm future of ballet we need to provide them with a framework and a goal to work towards with constant support and coaching in an environment where they can work with their peers and possibly leading artists and choreographers perhaps more importantly provide them with the opportunity to experience performance themselves what better way to reignite a passion for ballet than to let them experience the thrill of performance famed music director viotti diesviotti director

back in the s now in its twentyfirst year sundance continues to grow some  people are estimated to have descended on this small ski town with nothing but movies on the mind its an opportunity to meet and make deals redford wanted sundance to be a platform for independent filmmakers but the commercial success of many showcased films have led to criticism that the festival is becoming too mainstreamsmaller festivals like slamdance and xdance which take place during the same week in park city are competing for sundances limelight but redford is not worried the more the merrier he says

he reserves particular disdain for the current republican administration its the ability to maintain the importance of dissent in a democratic system which right now is under threat with the attitude of this administration he says i think many voices are being shut down or accused of being unpatriotic if they want to express another point of view thats very unhealthy and very dangerousif we take that policy into the world there will be the same victims and the same consequences sundance isnt just one big screening there are discussion panels and qa sessions with directors tackling controversial topics like americas culture wars and the iraq war while redford wishes the festival to be a forum for dissent the profile of the audience is fairly monolithic educated middle class and predominantly white americans comes sundance with views from the same end of the political spectrum  antiwar and socially liberal but redford knows this and started the sundance tv channel in an effort to reach a wider audience when you look at the films here what we are presenting is very much egalitarian and its about good films and good storytelling be it african america asian women gay lesbian sooner or later we will do away with those stereotypical labels and people will say its just a film by soand so dvd review harry potter and the prisoner of azkabangone are the warm bright colours found in the two earlier films alfonso cuaron brings in a bleak and cold feel that is simply gorgeous  and looks even better here than in the cinema it is all part of the progression of harrys story into darker areas but youll spend time just marvelling at the beautiful hogwarts landscapethis is the first potter film where you get so lost in the screen adaptation that you forget the book it is the third year at hogwarts and studies are interrupted as they always are by a calamity that only harry ron and hermione can put rightit sounds corny but harry is no longer the winsome hero he is a moody teenager and daniel radcliffe pulls it off very well emma watson is ever better as hermione and the young stars are joined by the usual myriad famous actors including gary oldman and emma thompson the film itself is the reason to buy this dvd but it is laden with behindthescenes extras including funny if shallow interviews with all the main cast but what seems like a long list of features can be swiftly whittled down to the few that you are going to watch younger viewers will go for the games which include a magic you may have missed memory test and crookshanks chasing off after scabbers adult viewers will ignore those and go straight to the deleted scenes you will understand why they were deleted but it is fun to see more footage  and not have to hunt through endless menus to find it as we did on the first harry potter dvd the most interesting pieces are an interview with jk rowling in creating the vision and conjuring a scene a short featurette about the making of the films big moments vera drake scoops film awardvera drake  leighs s drama about a backstreet abortionist  was named best film and staunton who played the title role was named best actress other

meryl streep and whisked her around leicester square based on the cult childrens books by author daniel handler the film follows three children who are orphaned when their parents die in a fire they are taken in by their wicked uncle count olaf played by carrey who schemes to get his hands on their fortune director nairs vanity projectthe book is one of the classics of english literature  the story of scheming th century social climber becky sharp played in the film by reese witherspoon nair said that she jumped at the chance to work on the film which she has  controversially  made in a bollywood style including two songanddance routines in the films second half it was serendipity really  i was offered vanity fair by the studio focus features who had distributed monsoon wedding nair told bbc world services masterpiece programme they offered me their nextbest thing not realising that vanity fair had actually been one of my favourite novels since i was  years old in an irish catholic boarding school in indiasince her  debut feature salaam bombay  nominated for the best foreign language oscar and winner of best first feature at cannes  nair has become one of indias most famous and respected directors she is not restricted to bollywood however  she followed salaam bombay with mississippi masala starring denzel washington and the perez family her first hollywood filmher career peaked with monsoon wedding in  which won the golden lion award at venice nairs indianstyle adaptation of vanity fair however has been attacked by critics in the us  where it only reached number eight at the box office in its opening week  who described the bollywood elements as jarring the film has a new ending with becky sharp running off for a new life in india but nair said that her film had picked up on the way thackeray  who was born in india but moved to england as a young man  had seen the world first when i was  it was becky sharp who is a completely memorable character because i recognised myself in her  i recognised all the ladies who did not want to be ladies who wanted to buck the system that they were in she said but it was the sort of novel i somehow kept at the side of my bed for many years and i would dip into every now and then and suddenly get completely mesmerised again as i got older and read it i think it was thackerays clarity  his clearsightedness about his own society the fact that he was born in india but came to england as a young man  that gave him the eyes of an outsider and yet he was an insider that perspective was something i really lovednair also defended her decision to cast an american actress  reese witherspoon  as becky sharp despite the fact that all the rest of the cast are british or irish i cast intuitively  in my films i cast as many nonactors as i cast actors she said for me it is intuition  i have to fall in love with an actor it is a visceral responsethackeray describes becky sharp as a minx also shes described as someone whos tiny redheaded and thin reese had that completely minxlike irresistibility about her having won the role because she seemed physically perfectly suited to the part however witherspoon then became pregnant but nair said that though this had created the need for some filming tricks it had in fact also helped the film it was a selffulfilling prophesy  when i first met her husband actor ryan philippe i said knock her up wont you i need some flesh on the girl she joked im not a fan of the underfed los angeles actor at all this was for me about becky sharp being eventually a fullblown woman through the course of the film i love the luminosity that pregnancy brings i love the fleshiness i love the ample bosom  it gave me much more to play with nair explained how camera tricks had been used to disguise witherspoons bump in various scenes  including hiring a number of young boys in costumes to stand in front of her she runs she gets off coal carts she jumps off horses  she does everything nair said but theres also a certain carriage with horses that is going to wipe the screen at a certain moment because of the bump spirit awards hail

christmas day dvd review spiderman its not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning a few effects look false but tobey maguire kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film then there are commentaries trailers and a blooper reelsometimes quality comes in bulk this set contains no less than  john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet mannow is that a christmas present or what give this to someone on  december and you wont see them again until early in the new year its not truly a complete collection and leans more toward waynes earlier films theres no true grit for instance though there is hellraisers the films look well transferred to dvd though none has extrasit was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous  series became a cult favourite thats been long awaited on dvd this set has the first season of buck gil gerard and wilmas erin gray tongueincheek adventures and its all as camp and gaudy as you remember but its also a disappointment the us dvd has this and the more pofaced second season  and you can import it for just about the same price the bigger omission though is that there are no extras thats particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them baby becomes new oscar favouriteaccording to pundits the film has overtaken

carter cash previously said it upset her husband when kilgore talked about the song without crediting her and believed he should not have been credited on it last year kilgore turned up an awards dinner in a wheelchair expecting to honour hank williams jr but instead he was the surprise recipient of a lifetime achievement award from the international entertainment buyers association my memories of marleypartridge worked with marley from  until the jamaican musicians death in  i joined island records in  and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre it was one of the last dates he did in london the album exodus came out in  and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status by  he was the biggest touring attraction in the world i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts bob was one of the most mesmeric people ive ever had the privilege to work with he must have had an iron will to succeed bob was a very driven individual you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in he didnt suffer fools gladly at the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest ive ever seen i saw him many times i recall in  he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a halfhour interview it was interrupted to do a rehearsal he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tvhe sat down in front of the tv and after  minutes it was obvious he wasnt going to move that was the end of it the mirror had a very truncated interview the last time i saw him was in london in  i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham bob was a good player we are talking about jamaicanstyle football he was an attacking midfield player his team assembled wherever his gigs were we played in brazil against some world cupwinning players it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america reggae did not correspond with disco in the s but bob in the s became one of the great icons in america and the third world in  ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere in places john lennon or elvis wouldnt be no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music well  was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before of course the  tour never happened but the whole of africa would have embraced him we cant speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just  years old i had no sense his career was going to go downhill bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind im sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic the final tune of his final album was redemption song  one of the most incredible classics of all time belle named best scottish bandthe group beat travis and idlewild into second and third place respectively franz ferdinand who recently picked up five brit award nominations ended up in th place while the eurythmics wound up at a lowly  other scottish acts such as the mull historical society who also featured in the top  performed at a party in glasgow where the result was announced scottishbased band snow patrol who finished th in the vote and have been nominated for a pair of brit awards were among the performers who covered wellknown scottish pop songs at the party on wednesday nightindie stalwarts belle  sebastian have enjoyed a chart career stretching back to  they were the surprise winners of the brit award for best breakthrough act two years later scottish bands from earlier musical eras also made it into the final list including s tartan boy band the bay city rollers and goth favourites the jesus and mary chainscottish magazine the list recently compiled a list of the top  scottish bands of all time but left the final decision to the public the magazines music editor mark robertson said the idea behind the project was simple  to rediscover the very best of scottish music from the finest musical talent spanning from the age of s rock through to s pop right up to todays international stars everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide he added bbc radio scotland presenter vic galloway who has been involved in the project said it had been great fun to look back at scotlands musical heritage and take note of upandcoming scottish acts dance music not dead says fatboythe commercial failure of the latest albums by britains two biggest dance acts  fatboy slims palookaville and the prodigys always outnumbered never outgunned  has been coupled with the closure of many superclubs and the folding of three dance music magazines last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize with the brits committee announcing that dance music is no longer where its happening in music these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album halfway between the gutter and the stars but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over every week when i was making the album i was reading articles about the demise of dance music  and obviously that affects you somewhat he told bbc world services the ticket programme i personally dont believe its either dead or going to die but its going through a bit of a fallow patch so i think consciously or subconsciously reading every week that dance music was dead i would think right scrub that track thenalthough his album sales in the uk are down  palookaville stayed in the uk top  for just three weeks  cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties and event on brighton sea front in  attracted  people while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of  the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that yearwith a crowd that big if the weathers nice the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think ive got them cook said im always really really nervous before the big ones  they had to give me valium before rio because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor for some reason especially now ive got a reputation for it the atmosphere and the joie de vivre thats already going on means all i have to do is play up records he promised more such parties in more locations around the world  despite problems after the brighton event which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt one man also died of a heart attack and a woman fell to her death during the free party were having to widen our horizons from just beaches because theres landlocked countries that want to get involved cook said were doing rio at the carnival at the maracana and sao paolo  our new gig is famous football stadiumsthe dj admitted however that his massive worldwide success had a downside with intense media interest in his personal life in particular he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary breakup of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball after she was linked with dj dan peppethe tabloid thing has been difficult at times cook said especially the meandzoegate  its quite scary he said that he had been determined that what had happened with ball did not affect the album at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldnt think i was depressed he explained then i thought thats not right and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence  that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended i said to zoe i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me do you mind if its on the album he recalled she said yeah its hilarious because your masochistic baby did leave you cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on  where paul mccartney is a neighbour its almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs cook explained if theres a pap at the end of the road everyone knocks on each others doors  paul comes round and we warn him because we dont know who theyre after label withdraws mcfaddens videost fintians high school says it is clearly identified in the video while mcfadden never went there mcfadden makes claims that he was beaten at his own school in the songs lyrics saying it had cell blocks the performers record label sony bmg has withdrawn the video and issued replacements to television stations the label believed the school name was fictitious until they received the complaint they have said the reference to the school was unintentional and coincidentalthe head of christian brothers school st fintians richard fogarty said the video implied that the yearold pop star had attended his school and was abused there the school has always treated its pupils with respect mr fogarty said in a statement mcfadden makes specific references to the christian brothers in his song but did not attend st fintians corporal punishment was outlawed in irish schools in  when mcfadden was two years oldmcfadden whose debut solo album is released next week has said that every song is autobiographical and a true story alcoholism and domestic violence are among the other topics dealt with in his songs half of which have been written with robbie williams former collaborator guy

livelihoods franz man seeks government helpfor any cultural output to thrive there needs to be some kind of state input to that as well he said but kapranos warned against musicians being too closely linked with mps at the university of edinburgh event i think the role of musicians is to question politicians rather than to go to bed with them he saidkapranos joined the prestigious lecture series to discuss scotlands role in making st century music there are elements of our musical output which require sustenance because they arent selfsufficient he said but socalled commercial music would benefit from investment as well he warned musicians against being allied to a particular party however i dont know if having tea with politicians is always a good ideakapranos and his glasgow fourpiece band have been nominated for five prizes at next weeks brit awards including best group and best album their selftitled debut album won last years mercury music prize and spawned three top  singles he told the strong audience at the universitys reid hall that musicians should listen to a wide range of music and should not be restricted by stereotypes we say i like this because i listen to nirvana and korn i am a troubled individual im riddled with angst because i listen to chopin and debussy i listen to kylie minogue and scissor sisters because im upbeat and i like to party i listen to wagner because i like the smell of napalm in the morning kapranos said there was a general hostility towards classical music adding there is very little done to break that hostility other than classic fmhe concluded we define ourselves as a nation by the way we encourage our creativity fellow speaker and classical composer james macmillan agreed we need to rediscover our ability to listen previous speakers at the edinburgh lectures series have included former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and author professor stephen hawking kapranos described his appearance on wednesday as more daunting by a long way than their upcoming brits performance i dont really care about the brits he said its going to be great to go down but i have actually had to exercise part of my brain tonighti think the government should do more to help upandcoming artists be discovered by scrapping the entertainment licences for live venues also they should do more to help independent record labels have a louder voice within an industry dominated by commercialised major labelsrather than expecting the government  ie the taxpayer  to fork out why dont some of the megastars put something back in some of britains wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums concerts etc there are far more important demands on government fundsif they can fund football why not fund musicareas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants so why not music we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cashthe government has enough problems funding schools and health services if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multibillion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into thatas a scot living in england i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success so i can see no problem with it franz ferdinand travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goodsi think the issue is more fundamental should the government be spending money on subsidising a multimillion pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state the answer is most definitely no those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldnt be looking for government subsidies i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorshipyes the government should fund music  it brings joy to the massesthere are already thousands of statefunded musicians out there sitting around twiddling their thumbs on the new deal getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better useas long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move i would hate to see more pop idoltype funding of music though as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked aboutonly if the proposals make financial sense franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales  if theyd had a government grant to get started theyd have more than paid it back by now so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out however the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides theyre a musician the government shouldnt fund music  it should invest in music and those investments should be treated like any other investmenti think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people however i do feel this should be the extent of their role to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from therei do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately the directors are in the business for if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldnt have to fork out a great dealyeah why not music should be government funded particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bandsartists and stuff pop music pretty much rules the earth so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer there is a great deal of money generated through pop music  perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idolstyle music  that is the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers call it a tax on music pollution if you likethough i really like franz ferdinand i have to disagree with mr kapranos once government gets their hand into the private sector it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues many years ago this was the case with the us nea when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privatelyfunded organizations like save the music in the us hard act to follow for outkastthe latest triumph adds to the three grammys and four american mtv gongs won earlier in this year andre  and big bois album speakerboxxxthe love below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world the double album  which saw the pair produce one disc each  topped the charts in the us at the same time as single hey ya it took another track from the exponents of southern hiphop  the way you move  to displace it from the top spot the georgia pairs year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow  what can be next for a musical act that has done it allg money a presenter on the bbcs urban music station xtra thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure  giving the band time to think about other interests they might be more appearances outside the band such as producing for other artists while they have a number of fringe music projects andre  would like to go into acting so we might see him a film while big boi already has a dogbreeding business says the djbut in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double cd their greatness has become clear with speakerboxxxthe love below we havent seen the last of them he adds outkasts musical career spans  years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past with their debut southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum but it took until  for the pair to score their first hit in the uk with ms jackson while their album stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the usxtras g money says it took the latest album released in  for him to be assured of their genius they have always been experimental some of it has worked and some hasnt he adds but g money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough what can you do next when youve done it all he says with ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame it seems that outkast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry sir paul rocks super bowl

this time he started off the show at the alltel stadium in jacksonville florida with the beatles numbers drive my car and get back he then performed a mellow version of live and let die the james bond theme he recorded with the band wings finally he closed the show with a rousing version of hey jude the former beatle resisted any temptation to refer to janet jacksons headlinegrabbing performance last year instead keeping banter between songs to a minimum in order to squeeze as much music as he could into his slot the singer removed his black jacket halfway through the show  but any fans

sampling battlethe punkrappers used three notes of music from flautist james newtons choir in their track from  although the group had paid a licence fee for the sample mr newton said his copyright had been infringed but the us court of appeal upheld its original decision that the group did not have to pay an additional fee to license the underlying composition the beastie boys  michael diamond adam horowitz and adam yauch  are considered to be one of early pioneers of sampling musicsampling now a standard practice among musicians involves taking a segment of one track and using it in a different song a threejudge panel of the court held in  that the band had abided by copyright protections by paying a licence fee for a sample of mr newtons recording that finding upheld a lowercourt dismissal of the case in favour of the beastie boys we hold that beastie boys use of a brief segment of that composition consisting of three notes separated by a halfstep over a background c note is not sufficient to sustain a claim for infringement of newtons copyright chief judge mary schroeder wrote in her opinion mr newton is a critically acclaimed jazz and classical flutist composer

the jackpot prize of us  however if she picks the wrong man then the impostor takes the money fox producers defended the show saying it was a positive experience they have made six specials though only one episode has so far been broadcastthe special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast said a fox spokesman however any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to preempt the schedule wraztv instead chose to air an independentlyproduced film i have

they join british stars jude law and kate winslet who have been booked for guest roles the comic and actor said he had drawn up an alist of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it we wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct gervais told bbc newsits not about the zeitgeist we wanted people who would still be around in  years not just the winner of big brother to take part gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line but he has met with stiller and jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to iti didnt want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who havent even been asked i have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as im going to be in a remake of  taking dudley moores part i havent been approached and i wouldnt take it anywayhe said stiller and jackson would be playing twisted versions of themselves in extras and that the jokes about them would sail pretty close to the bone gervais and his writing partner stephen merchant are currently refining the scripts for the sixpart series in which gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars meanwhile gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book flanimals which is released in the us in march around the same time as nbc begin showing the us version of the office the film rights to flanimals have already been snapped up but gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly a film will happen over the next three years but i

a stool as shoppers wandered around the openfronted shop packed with his furniture among the items from his homes in los angeles and london were countless sofas chairs pictures beds and memorabilia from his past tv shows asked the reason for the sale evans said i just want to get rid of it all its just a headache he added it feels good to be selling this stuff its a weight off my mind look at it all theres so much clutter ive enjoyed every bit of furniture and every poster but its not important anymore the normally gregarious evans cut a peculiarly unshowbusinesslike figure as he sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes wrapped in a big coat and scarf in front of his aladdins cavehowever the ostentation of some of the items on sale painted a picture of the eccentricity that endeared him to the british public in shows such as channel s gameshow dont forget your toothbrush the most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size sofas looked like they could seat a small party and a bed seemed big enough for four the elaborate nature of the pieces many custommade had to be admired particularly a huge red and gold upholstered throne and a stripy deckchair from the queen mary linerto help people in their browsing evans had given the pieces labels with not only the price but a helpful often comic aside isnt it great was the comment on the  throne and bob dylans old sofa  honest was written on a dark wood couch priced the prices were steep by a lot of peoples standards but evans said it was not deterring shoppers ive sold quite a lot already everything here is on sale for less than i bought it for but its not really about the money its about getting rid of it all weve all been bartering thats what its all about he added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making vintage tv and film posters also lined the walls including a rare portrait of raquel welch and an original advertising print from the benny hill show and almost hidden at the back of the lockup were the two giant toothbrushes from his former channel  show although these were not for saledespite the sheer curiosity value of the sale there was a healthy trickle of interest from the public rather than the perhaps expected crowds some wandered in just to browse as they would any of the other stalls not knowing that it belonged to evanspaul burgess said i didnt realise i thought it was just a load of junk i should go back and have a better look but local resident francesca detakats came specially to the stall and left happy with her purchase of an original s photograph of the who by david wedgburg ms detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying  for the print if you like something you dont really count it like that she saidmartin hellewell who had also made a point of visiting evans shop said he thought it was a great idea why not if youve got stuff to get rid of its a good place to do it said mr hellewell evans has taken out the stall with business partner pete winterbottom they plan to open every day if possible although evans did not know how often he would be there well stay definitely until christmas and then maybe a week after that said evans top stars join us tsunami tv showandy garcia lucy liu natalie portman and jay leno are also among the new names for saturdays tsunami aid they will join alist

at a time when many have large backlogs science investigators claim lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc crime scene investigation csi and its spinoffs csi miami and csi new york have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlanticeach episode a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science  and the extensive resources at their disposal the csi effect is basically the perception of the nearinfallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show said max houck who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university us this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it  including the cops and prosecutors  and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science aaas the american forensics expert said there were roughly  backlogged dna samples in us labs yet these constituted just  of the total test backlog said dr houck forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the shows influence in dealing with the families of victims what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case she explained for example on television the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously but when people find out that it can take several months they can find that very difficultdr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most peoples perceptions the shows influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom making lawyers jittery prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because for example they wonder why wasnt everything tested well in fact not everything needs to be tested dr houck explained defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut this objective method thats always accurate however he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field my university course started with four graduates in  were now the largest major on campus  with  students he said dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level theres more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research ethnic producers face barriersminority ethnic led mel production companies face barriers in succeeding in the film and television industries research has suggestedthe study commissioned by pact and the uk film council included interviews with industry experts and individuals they indicated that career progression and a lack of role models are among the main problems within such companies the research indicated that about  of independent production companies in the uk are minority ethnic leda minority ethnic led company is defined as one in which the majority of decisionmaking power rests with an individual or individuals from a minority ethnic group the report also explored the problems faced by such companies when attempting to compete within the film and tv industries it said they are often smaller than other companies and lack the resources so are often squeezed out of the market by bigger firms the research recommended that minority ethnic led companies could benefit from such positive actions as career training and business advice plus improved communication within the film and tv sectors the uk has a rich and diverse culture and it is essential that it is reflected on film and television said arts minister estelle morris of the findings i welcome this report which i hope will lead to more doors being opened and all

accounts committee called for the national audit office to be given a free hand to investigate how the bbc offers value for money although six areas are to be opened up to scrutiny the audit office should have more power to choose what it investigated the mps said the call was made in a report into the bbcs freeview digital service our aim is not to rewrite the storyline of eastenders but simply to ensure that the bbc is as accountable to parliament as any other organisation spending public money said the committee chairman mp edward leigh the bbcs spending is not subject to the full independent scrutiny and accountability to parliament parliament requires television owners to pay a licence fee and expects the comptroller and auditor general on behalf of parliament to be able to scrutinise how that money over  billion a year is useda bbc spokeswoman said we share the committees interest in ensuring the public money we receive is spent well though in its infancy we think the arrangements with the nao are working well and should be given time to mature the report said the freeview digital service has had an impressive take up since its launch but the bbc must still dispel confusion about the service the committee found the bbc had succeeded in ensuring subscriptionfree access to digital channels following the collapse of itv digital in  but the fact that one in four homes could not access freeview remained a problemthe report said that while gaps in the coverage were largely due to landscape issues there was need for detailed explanations on the freeview website and on promotional literature as to why it was not available in specific areas the government has proposed switch off of the analogue television signal with  the most recently proposed date the bbc launched freeview in  as an alternative to satellite subscription services such as sky to allow its digital channels such as bbc three and news  to be seen there have been an estimated five million freeview settop boxes sold since the launch and prices have fallen considerably the corporation plans to spend up to m on freeview before  to ensure people can receive the service throughout the uk

million according to the nielsen ratings system five other episodes of the show had also been filmed will be dropped from foxs schedules ms berman said she was predicting a drop in ratings even for some of the networks established reality shows such as american idol which is due to start its fourth series this week fox had unveiled a new strategy last year promising to launch new shows every

impress although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any busted concert gone were the screaming girls to which simpson had become accustomed support act brigade fronted by simpsons brother played a short set first and were met with general approval when fightstar eventually took to the stage around pm however a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowdunfortunately the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as simpsons guitar amplifier failed to work as sound technicians rushed to fix it other band members did their best to improvise when they eventually got under way fightstars blend of emotionally charged

believes rap act raw t  signed to his f label the fourth incarnation of factory  will complete the hattrick suddenly when raw t came into my life i realised they are my third major band he told bbc world services the music biz programme the group are set to release their first single on  february and follow it up with an album realise and witness in marchwilson has twice tried to resurrect factory  which lasted for  years before folding  but conceded these efforts had been despondent and dismal experiences but it has not put him off of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing ive ever done and the thing i have most loved is being part of a record company he addedthe idea of working with brilliant young musicians and being close to the centre of popular culture is just the biggest thrill in my life wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t but he had initially been reluctant saying he detested young british people rapping its always inauthentic its always crass it never really works for me he said i went to see this group raw t  which stands for realise and witness talent  and like everyone else in the room that night we were utterly blown away wilson believes raw t could be to f as joy division were to factory recordsthe story of factory records  which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester  was told in the michael winterbottom film  hour party people in which wilson was played by steve cooganwilson stressed that the independent music scene remained as important as it had been during the s when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes  perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium  were signed to indies i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is and how bands prefer it he added they can make more money that way  its a more generous relationship and also its a more understanding relationship i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time singer sizzla jailed for swearingthe singer must serve  days in prison after he consistently swore

and concert promoters covering eight of the scenes biggest stars but the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up instead the record companies have

televised on itv on thursdayim speechless best song of the last  years yeah righti very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single its a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better beforegive us a breakbest song in  years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but reallylistened to angels on radio  this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfectionas usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last  years that deserve this award more its not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty lowim actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last  yearswhat about the specials  ghost town the buzzcocks  ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays  kinky afro mcalmont  butler  yes joy division  love will tear us apart angels is middleoftheroad rubbishangels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap its musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isnt very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish musicbest of the last  years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last  years after allits alright for a pop song  but the best song of the last  yearsthere is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last  yearsits a travestyrubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio  but i dont recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldnt know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last  years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out  where on earth did this dreadful list appear fromwhile i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last  years should not include songs less than  years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good showyouve got to be kiddingangels is a great song but not the best song of the last  years only the best song to be up for nomination at the britsi think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i dont think its the best song from the past  years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place  he is alright but the song isnt that good im happy for robbie himself thoughbest song in the last  years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesnt deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awardsso boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me its proof that music and democracy just dont mix still at least it wasnt will youngoh its all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even nonfans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talenti hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and noone to slowdance withi agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbiei think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isnt really that good a song it certainly isnt anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bushangels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers its a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groupsrobbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the bestwe forget about the late s and early s for example they werent cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people thinkyes angels is the best song since the past  years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaningive always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british preteens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting its orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who dont particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing  it is merely an irritating distraction  a wasp that refuses to go away on a summers afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it  you should feel ashamed of yourself  you probably only know a dozen songs or so dont you  so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisssangels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but  no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say  really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a centuryno surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven yearold girl perhaps i mean will young come onwhat a load of crap best song in the last  years  i dont think so what about all the real artists out there over the last  years  the list is endless but robbie williams doesnt even come closewhat a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radios off why a halfbaked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past  years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give upwhy do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last  years i think not i didnt realize radio  had so many listeners under the age of people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last  years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for herethe great british public at work again its a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted its not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nopeno because im not female and im not ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past  years the shortlist wasnt great but him winning it is a jokepredictable and laughablethe success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last  years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbies repertoire never mind best song of the last  yearsi am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs  music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the listhave radio  listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last  years than robbie williams ever willno doubt about it theres not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other songit should have been joy divisionthose guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in  years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music todayyes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winneri am astounded that such a secondrate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs its a terrible song voted for by the masses who dont have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting musicthe best song of the past  years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie downit just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose its confirmed one thing  the british public are consistently dull  ltno offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffini think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesnt deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dustobviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for itif this is the best song of the last  years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best recorda sad day for musicits not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people thats why it has been voted best song of the last  years its a good allrounder just like robbiebest song in  years since  im confused angels isnt a bad song its a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything its regressive bland even i suppose its just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have becomegranted angels is a good song however it really wasnt up against any other proper competition the queens song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why werent the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angelsi wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasnt getting more awards so they had to make one up for himbest song of the last  years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasnt bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankfulangels is without doubt a great song but i really dont think it deserves the title of best song in  yearsperhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song dont get me wrong im not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winnersit would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with  people singing along to be fully appreciated well done robi find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past  years im rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popularive nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near us new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profitno surprise really its voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in musicpersonally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heardit absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to comeits an absolute joke however most of the original  were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didnt end up in the hands of will young thoughalthough it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares  u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talentalthough angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last  years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if thats all it means jamelias return to the topthe birminghamborn singer full name jamelia davis was signed to a record label at the age of  and released her first single so high at  she released four number ones from her  album drama including the top five hit money featuring the vocals of reggae artist beenie man she racked up five mobo nominations in  winning one for best video but in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter teja who was born in march  while she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single during her absence rb music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene meaning jamelia had to once again prove herself her comeback song bout featuring rah digga only just scrapped into the top it was her next single superstar that really put her back on the map as one of britains most popular female rb singers holding her own in a music scene dominated by us artists such as beyonce and ashantisuperstar was followed by thank you winner of best single at the  mobos which reached number two in the uk charts the autobiographical song which deals with domestic abuse hit number one in new zealand and australia next came the song see it in a boys eyes which was especially written for her by coldplays chris martin his involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to rb she now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the nspcc and make trade fair despite her huge success in recent years jamelia remains downtoearth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business partly due to motherhood when i first got into the industry id be away from home for months at a time but now i have other things in my life i still want to make it but its not the end of the world if i dont commented jamelia cult band kasabian surge forwardthe fourpiece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock earning kasabian places on the best british group rock act and live act shortlists they have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic in contrast to fellow brit nominees such as keane and snow patrol british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again declared kasabians singer tom meighannoones doing it at the minute music feels like its in the afterlife right now we dont want people to give up on it the serpents going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriterguitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards a trio which began making music from the age of they enlisted guitarist and keyboard player christopher karloff after spotting him in a pub we saw his long sideburns and thought hey he looks the part well ask him said meighan inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore an early s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound we got a computer and we cut rocknroll up because theres no point in going back to how it was said meighan its all about new ideas and creativitythe bands original approach is reflected in its name inspired by linda kasabian  the getaway driver of us serial killer charles manson coincidentally it is also the armenian term for butcher kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there signed to the rca record label kasabian tested the water with two singles club foot and lsf which reached numbers  and  in the uk singles chart respectivelythey built up their following on the summer festival circuit opening both glastonbury and t in the park and at a series of guerilla gigs at unusual venues including half time orange a pub next to leicester city football clubs headquarters kasabians selftitled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses primal scream and the happy mondaysregarding it as both a fiery assertion of rock n roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of rutland water the nmes praise was typical of the albums reception as  progressed kasabian would score a further two hits  processed beats and cutt off  and embark upon a wellreceived uk tour we take our music seriously definitely but we want to have fun with it said pizzorno this is not a job to us added meighan this is the best life we could ever have this is what its all about and without it wed be lost souls but music needs us as well brits debate over urban musicim not really comfortable with the word urban its a word thats been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong how far are the brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing its so far removed that i dont expect them to get it bang on the music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people dont feel like thats anything to do with us i dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day its not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it its got nothing to do with whats really going onurban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop rb garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that shes a uk artist what has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a yearold from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  i think thats whats done itthe award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv basei dont think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that shes from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural the great thing about urban music is that theres a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge peoplewhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or awarda type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban lifeshe might not be urban but when did rb become the hip hop tainted thing it is now rb stands for rhythm and blues rememberthat joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hiphop soul  funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize joss stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win i cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she isshe did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and rb if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what im talking about very strangewhats in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance towhilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities  i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties ive been to good luck to joss stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an awardso what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black and if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it shes  has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this onethis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the s and s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it representsi demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities its way better out here we have hay for one thingexcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black toohow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsensei love joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their coloursurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that stylethe term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulrnb and hiphop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with crunkurban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now the word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for itim in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label id hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just musicas a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented  we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc whos ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both  times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos  but why not britsso what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing elseurban is pc version for saying black music im not doubting ms stones talent but why didnt jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thingrefreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itthat entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r  b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williamsurban is a nonsense term  music of black origin well doesnt that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in londonmanchester etc and doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesnt make any sensewhy does music have to be put into a genre its music you like it or you dont simple as thati play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as im concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musicallyurban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i dont know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as suchjoss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignoredyeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though theres only two kinds of music good and bad row threatens hendrix museum planthe rundown house in seattle has already

fell to number three us desire to be number onethe most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive if not always groundbreaking but such success is down to more than music they have to be compelling performers charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground they also have to want it they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it the beatles had it the rolling stones still have it rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit and u have it in spades and keep churning it out their new album how to dismantle an atomic bomb comes  years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and  years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the alltime rock alistthey may have lost some of the edginess and raw youthful force that propelled them to the top but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albumsvertigo the first single from the new album went straight into the uk singles chart at number one knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their th top  hit the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better  to make records the whole world will listen to bono recently said drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments were very competitive  we want to be on the radio have big singles we dont want to be thought of as a veteran band the band have done everything in their considerable powers to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world according to q magazine editor paul reesthis makes them hugely determined and formidable he added they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up as such theyve constantly reinvented and challenged themselves they are perhaps alone as the only rock band that has got better with age the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised mr rees said they do everything in the right way the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board attracting fellow pupils paul hewson bono vocals adam clayton bass david evans the edge guitar and his brother dickdick evans soon dropped out and the fourpiece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on uby  they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager paul mcguinness they were brilliant but very coarse mcguinness recently said in a way they were doing exactly what they do now only badly they struggled to attract record company attention later being described as pretty damn average and strange and eerie by scouts who saw them live they released two irelandonly singles which topped the national charts in  and  leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy the stadiumfilling anthemic sound was us aim from the start and their third album war saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic going to number one in the uk and  in the us songs like sunday bloody sunday and new years day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band  which bono rejected as a clichehis stage performances  which included flagwaving speakerclimbing and drumthrowing  earned him a reputation as an electric performer and their appearance at s live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardomin  the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name i still havent found what im looking for and with or without you those songs took the bands epic atmospheric sound to a simple powerful and popular pinnacle the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band  they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music plus wildly extravagant stage shows while still trying to retain their mass appeal the achtung baby album in  was followed by zooropa pop and their corresponding stadium tours which featured giant olives flying cars live phone calls to the white house and bonos transformation into alteregos the fly and macphisto he was also building a parallel reputation  not always to the pleasure of his bandmates  as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb they had sold  million albums around the world but they still want more lasting influence of legend charleshis sound encompassed so many styles  blues gospel jazz rock n roll even country  and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and rb scenescompared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators charles songs cast their spell on such s stalwarts as joe cocker steve winwood eric burdon and van morrison his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones with whom he recently recorded a duet if james brown was the godfather of soul then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers along with sam cooke he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the devils music of rb to pave the way for a new generation of soul artistswithout charles it is hard to imagine the tearstained atlantic rb sound of aretha franklin otis redding or wilson pickett he was also a talented jazz composer arranger and band leader playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david fathead newman unfortunately he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era  that of heroin addiction which led to him being arrested in  his string of s atlantic rb successes included songs that would be covered by the firstgeneration rock n roll greats including ive got a woman roy orbison elvis presley and hallelujah i love her so eddie cochran after the exuberance of his  signature song whatd i say charles turned towards a more poporiented style recording hoagy carmichaels sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind and the upbeat hit the road jackhe also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again more than  years after its release his  abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic his version of don gibsons i cant stop loving you topped the pop and rb charts in the us in  he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the peopleon it he took a stand on poverty and civil rights  echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder james brown curtis mayfield and marvin gaye more than  years later he would embrace contemporary production with his  album my world which featured hiphop beats  although charles claimed at the time not to know what hiphop was among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged  in june  was one from his friend the producer quincy jones who described him as a brother in every sense of the word there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did he said former manfred mann singer paul jones who sang on s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la said charles was one of his heroes im quite sure my own writing was influenced by him he told bbc news online i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever grammys honour soul star charlescharles who died in  got honours including record and album of the year while alicia keys and actor jamie foxx performed a musical tribute to him rb star

dead i thought i should explain myself before i disappear said michael who was at the berlin film festival to launch the documentary the film a different story chronicles michaels life and career from the s and his personal struggles the yearold charttopper told reporters in the german capital that he wanted to move his career into a different form but added that he does not know what it is going to be yetim still going to be making music he said but added that he was not going to be around he hinted at discontent with the current state of music industry and said i dont really think that there is anyone in the modern pop business who i feel i want to spar with michael said that the film directed by southan morris would put his two decades of fame into context its almost as much for me as for my fans in terms of trying to make sense of the last  years and bring it to a close in a proper way he said the documentary chronicles the highs and lows of his life in the public gaze from his meteoric rise as one half of pop duo wham to his arrest for lewd conduct in a los angeles toilet in  the film also deals with the loss of michaels partner anselmo feleppa from an aidsrelated condition

dedicated to the rock legend the vast archive of instruments signed records and posters were collected by a dedicated fan who had become friendly with the star the auction was billed as the biggest

widely considered one of the best guitarists of his era died of a drug overdose in  at the age of  the  fender stratocaster was used by the musician on tour and in his studio a poem written by hendrix

sale hosted by auctioneers cooper owen was held at the hard rock cafe in london german music in a zombie statetim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world services the music biz programme that the countrys music industry was now struggling to survive renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties  such as downloading  its decline could become irreversible the problem the music industry has got is that they arent willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombiethe music market in germany peaked in  with sales of bn euros bn since  sales have plummeted to just bn euros bn in  in the space of one year  between  and   cd album sales fell by  but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a goodselling record this was particularly damagingyou need time he added however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed its quite true that we have severe problems in germany  but thats true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying i dont agree that the music industry lost control over the music market  in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copyingbut he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading we were the first to implement a download service  back in  he argued at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy  it was the napster time when pp services became popular it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby its nice its fun he added we try to make clear its not nice and its not fun  its endangering the creativity in our country musical treatment for

starred in the  film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time it is barely known inside austriathe film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early s the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazioccupied austria in sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austrias reluctance to embrace the musical another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria including yodelling goatherds and lederhosen the production is being staged at a viennese opera house the volksoper beginning on saturday maria the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp will be played by austroaustralian actress and singer sandra pires download chart debut is delayedthe british phonographic industry bpi had planned to include download formats in the chart from  march but the date has been put back to  april to create a level playing field for independent labels the bpi is concerned that independent repertoire is not adequately represented online and said they were looking at ways of rectifying itbpi chairman peter jamieson said the inclusion of download formats in the official uk singles chart is the most significant development in the charts for  yearsbut for a multitude of reasons the current chart representation of independent repertoire at the major download outlets is poor i am very pleased we have secured this delay on behalf of independents we have to try and establish a realistic level playing field of opportunity the official uk charts are run by the official uk charts company occ  a joint venture between the bpi and the british association of record dealers bard at an occ board meeting on wednesday the occ board agreed with bpi members that the  march start date be postponed

orleans jail he is awaiting a second trial after an original conviction was thrown out im not pleased jefferson parish sheriff harry lee said he will not make another video in my jail footage for the video was filmed by two crews who had permission to interview cmurder  one from court tv and one from a local cable showbut mr lee said he did not know the rapper had filmed the video and made an album behind bars and said he was fooled into letting the cameras in the rappers lawyer ron rakosky said the bottom line is we didnt do anything wrong mr rakosky said it was better than cmurder real name corey miller just sitting there wasting away heres a guy in jail making constructive use of his time instead of withering away he said hes lost more than three years of his life locked up for a crime he did not commitbut local group victims and citizens against crime said he should not be working behind bars he is a suspect in a murder case i dont think he should be allowed these privileges especially earning money until his name is totally cleared the groups president beverly siemssen said in  cmurder was found guilty of killing a yearold in a nightclub but that decision was thrown out last april he is now facing a second trial on a charge of seconddegree murder with two brothers in the group tru he had two us top  albums in the late s before going solo when he scored another three top  albums music man to the oscarsthis year marks contis th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess its just a television show but we always think its a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than  times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the houseits a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you dont know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director its exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we dont know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds contithe orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the shows producersthe decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the directors box to the orchestra via contis earpiece i dont feel good about it at all its not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we dont usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person thats been cut off whos  feet from me is glaring at me like its death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in  for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in  for gonna fly now from rocky and in  for the title song from for your eyes onlyits a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but theres this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and theyre either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever metthe image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with theres a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear  different things at different timesi have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone thats attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains contis most nervewracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in  when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the shows director i start cursing and screaming i tell him were not going to die for this show  you must do something or im going to climb out of this pit with  musicians and were going to be home in  minutes oh no bill dont do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra  or so of them in the pit and while were playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died its not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governors ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says im not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day church urges nelly show

revamp chart showthey hope to boost ratings for the longrunning show which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radios hit  uk rundown radio s chart show is an institution and remains the stations single most popular show says jk also known as jason king for years people have been tuning in at four oclock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes not that i ever did that but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a changethat change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio  slot the pair have worked together for a decade  meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key  and winning two sony radio awards they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors and pure soap on bbc threeon the revamped chart show their cheeky laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases in addition to the singles chart itself the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme says ross the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top  now you can just click on the internet to find that out so the show has plenty of extra items too the shows reduced reliance upon the top  also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc vinyl or cassettei personally buy downloads rather than cd singles says yearold ross even my grandma can download songs now jk is still struggling with the technology though but its premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead ross adds while sales of singles on traditional formats are down interest in songs has been revived by download sales which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the weekross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday while king is more of an rb and dance music fan so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes says king  who describes outgoing host butters as an extremely professional and competent broadcasterthe advantage joel and i have is that were a double act with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive king says wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him and if not i could always use a cleaner he jokes ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show other people can worry about that we are going to continue doing what we do well he says at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining nobody died rapper  cent scores chart firsthis track candy shop remained at the top of the charts while disco inferno crept up from six to five  cent also

coproductions in britain fell from  in  to  last yearlast year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the uk several projects were shelved

film production when bridget jones the edge of reason wimbledon and thunderbirds were all filmed in the ukthe drop was expected as there was no way s record level of production could be bettered the councils spokesperson said the reduction in indigenous film production in  was due to a variety of factors including the continuing longterm trend towards coproduction of films in more than one

hack  knocking out crime stories horrors westerns anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership words of more than two syllables were discouraged characters were either all good or bad with no shades of grey so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline he assumed the dumb name stan lee now legally adoptedby the time he was  lee had decided he was too old for the comic game his britishborn wife joan suggested he had nothing to lose and for his swansong should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman superman and wonder woman timely needed to respondlees answer in  was the fantastic four  a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays they were to change lees life and the comics industry forever lee gave each character individual everyday teenage problems such as dandruff ingrown toenails and acne they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other the fan letters poured in without immediately knowing it stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics and his imagination was rekindled his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics soon after nerdy peter parker was transformed  after a bite from an irradiated spider  into someone who could crawl up the sides of new yorks skyscrapers spiderman was born he was to become an icon of modern popular culture spidey as he is affectionately known had quite extraordinary powers  yet he had problems at work at home and with his girlfriends at last the teenager was no longer just the sidekick but the main hero and the hero was no longer just brawn he had brains toojust because hes a hero and has super powers doesnt

his heroes bangkok film festival battles onthe festivities have been scaled down red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund apart from this however the festival has continued as originally planned when the disaster happened we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel said the festivals executive director craig prater the decision was made that we would continue but that the focus would changeour premieres became fundraisers the opening night was visibly toned down and  of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund he continued but we feel like weve turned a page weve acknowledged our position and now its business as usualmr praters sentiments were echoed by christine rush director of the festivals sister event the bangkok film market we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nations recovery from this terrible disaster she saidhowever the nations recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out she added given the conspicuously low audience figures that support may be more symbolic than significant however poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficultiesthe eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leighs abortion drama vera drake that said the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoerson a more positive note the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city problems securing air transport the clash with last sundays golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancelbut the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher alongside such screen stars as michael douglas jeremy irons and jeanclaude van damme irons whose film being julia is in competition for the festivals golden kinnaree awards said he had wondered whether he should attend after decembers catastrophe i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened the british actor said i thought it might be in rather bad taste but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on now ive come here im very glad what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west he continued basically i was invited here by thailand if they still want you to come you shouldnow in its third year bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong tokyo and pusan in south korea mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal its grown awfully fast in three years  maybe too fast he concedes weve had some bumps in the road but thats only because the festival is still a baby i have no doubt in my mind that in five years this will be the top asian

departments outside london director of television jana bennett said the changes were about getting the best ideas on screen as efficiently and effectively as we can the new structure in each genre is designed to ensure that happens she saida number of new roles are being created in each department including a head of comedy commissioning based in glasgow the new person will be in charge of the m budget and their role will be to develop shows outside the capital both within the bbc and with independent production companies jane lush controller of entertainment commissioning said entertainment and comedy are incredibly important to our audiences im confident these changes will help us get the very best programmes on screen similar positions will also be created in the other departments with the new commissioning editor for documentaries based in bristol and the daytime commissioning editor in birmingham ms bennett said the new roles would benefit those making programmes within the bbc as well as those making shows for the channel independently a strong independent sector and a flourishing inhouse production base are not mutually exclusive and will stimulate the competition that will deliver the best ideas to the audience she said how the academy awards flourishedhow it all started the first academy awards were handed out in  at a comparatively lowkey dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel  just over the road from their modern day homejust  guests attended with ticket prices at the first film to win was wings which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award for the first  years or so the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at pm but in  the winners were published in the los angeles times at pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced leading to the secrecy and suspensefilled night that happens today when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until  but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinnerthe ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous graumans chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium they are now held at the kodak theatre which opened in  just across the road from its original home and holds  people until  they were held on a thursday then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february the first televised ceremony was in  with bob hope as the mc who was oscar there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscarone popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an articlethe first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburns first best actress win in  the academy officially adopted the nickname in  the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons since its inception  oscars have been handed out in support of the war effort the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii after the war winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing fiftyfive statues were stolen in en route to the awards in   were recovered nine days later winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out who sits in judgement the academy was set up in  as a nonprofit organisation with  members from different film disciplines douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards there are now  members of the academy  with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers some of the criteria for admittance includes film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy receipt of an academy award nomination achievement of unique distinction earning of special merit or making an outstanding contribution to film the stars who left emptyhanded while many of the biggest films and moviemakers have been honoured by the academy there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classicsamong the overlooked films were hobsons choice dirty harry the  steps the searchers and king kong actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer  humphrey bogart in casablanca  gene kelly in singing in the rain  and henry fonda in  angry men  alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in  the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event there were calls for it to be cancelled in  during the war in iraq but as it didnt stop during world war ii or the vietnam wardocumentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions los angeles floods in  saw it put back a week the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in

globe awardand it is the first nomination for actress okonedo chosen for her performance in hotel rwanda about the  rwandan genocide it is also a debut nomination for staunton  who told bbc news  she had not thought the film would appeal to academy voters it was an extraordinary time making the film and i cant believe what has happened this morning she said i hope it just shows mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is we are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way leigh who had previously received three oscar nominations for secrets and lies and topsy turvy told bbc news  the latest success was amazing he said we hoped that imelda staunton would get a nomination but i never expected to get director and screenplay its just absolutely wonderfuli think people are aware that its about life  and i hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people winslet said she was ecstatic about the fourth nomination of her career being nominated means so much to me to be nominated for a film that was released a while ago i feel so honoured and overwhelmed she said john woodward chief executive of the uk film council said it was extremely heartening to see british filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why national lottery investment in

colombia for a lead for maria full of grace the film sees the yearold play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance making it all the more surprising that this is her first film her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards instead recognising quirkier lowbudget films and at the  berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize therons oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied award sandino moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment but she is taking her time committing to her next project hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenabar bening makes awards breakthroughbening who was born in texas in  has gained prominence for a string of key roles although an oscar has so far eluded her her status as one of hollywoods favourite actresses remains solid one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for benings role as troubled carolyn burnham in s american beauty but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swanks leading role in boys dont cry after opening her career in the theatre  and gaining a tony award nomination in   bening had a lowkey spell in television she then made her film debut as a sexstarved wife in s the great outdoors opposite comics dan akroyd and john candyfollowing a cameo in postcards from the edge benings breakthrough role came in  playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters  a role that won her an oscar nomination despite some rave reviews bening did not win the best supporting actress academy awardhowever the highprofile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions costarring with some of hollywoods greatest players including robert de niro and harrison ford but it was her role opposite warren beatty in  gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact bening played virginia hill another role which won her high critical acclaim but the film only picked up two of a staggering  oscar nominationsbugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening  she married beatty with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe the couple now have four children together a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered benings career in the mids she played michael douglas opposite number in romantic comedy the american president and as a fiery queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeares richard iiibening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty director sam mendes film debut which was a critical and commercial success  but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance but current film being julia has made bening an awardwinning actress rather than the perennial nominee with success at the golden globes the witty tale of revenge and love set in s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva  played by bening  grow tired of her success and fall for a young american  and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award oscars steer clear of controversyif best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches two of the frontrunners would have had to be michael moores bushbaiting documentary fahrenheit  and mel gibsons the passion of the christ both films polarised opinion but had critics talking and the public turning up to see them  fahrenheit  breaking us box office records for a documentary and the passion of the christ making more than usm m in the us alone but this years academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies with the passion of the christ  a film accused of being antisemitic  receiving nominations only in the minor categories of cinematography makeup and musical scorefahrenheit  has also been overlooked despite winning the palme dor at the cannes international film festival in moores caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors decision to enter it in the best picture category rather than best documentary says tim dams the news editor of trade magazine screen international but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moores film does not sit well with the academy if you look at past oscar winners and nominees the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative epicstyle pictures fahrenheit  didnt really fit in to that category they tend to go for films like titanic gladiator and the lord of the rings films with scale that often arent too contentious he said while he said the oscar voting panel were not snubbing moores film he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category i think its more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub he saidthe problem with mel gibsons film he believed was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic an ancient middle eastern languagehollywood doesnt tend to like foreignlanguage films  noones ever tried doing a film in a dead language he said but aside from these two films some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations the german film the downfall a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker has been recognised in the best foreign film category the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man rather than a semimythical historical monster but mr dams said its not an inflammatory film it has done very well in germany and its a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster another contentious film mr dams said has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charmindependent filmmaker morgan spurlock may have forced fastfood giant mcdonalds to withdraw its super size portions in the us after he went on a monthlong diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals  and filmed his progressthe film has been a hit around the world mr dams said its a political film but its quite fun and punky and wellpaced morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy its a very accessible film and it doesnt beat you over the head with its views while in fahrenheit  there are moments of comedy i think the way that super size me is put together  the fact its a very likeable film  means its won through on charm dams pick at this years oscars the aviator martin scorseses biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes tinseltown it seems likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own kidman wins photographer battlethe oscarwinning star took action against jamie fawcett and ben mcdonald after a bugging device was found outside her home earlier this week lawyers for the pair denied allegations they had planted the device the australian actress is currently in sydney to film her latest movie eucalyptus with russell crowe kidman was prompted to take action following a reported highspeed car chase with members of the paparazzi in sydney last weekendaccording to local newspaper the daily telegraph the incident

kidman sought the apprehended violence orders  normally used in australia in cases of domestic violence and similar incidents  after being advised to do so by local police nicole would like to make it clear that she acknowledges she is a public figure and that reporters and photographers have a job to do and she respects that said kidmans publicist wendy day however these are specific actions

restraining order at waverley local court in sydney said she understood the photographers were entitled to earn a living but there had to be limits to their behaviour miss kidman says shes willing to

shot up from  before the s to  after  vera drakes bafta triumph hopevera drake mike leighs tale about a s backstreet abortionist is nominated in  categories these include best film best director and best actress shortlist for imelda staunton who plays the eponymous character the film has spent months being lauded with prizes from the venice film festival to five awards from the london critics circle on wednesday nightthe baftas has a tradition of honouring british cinema and this year vera drake is the obvious candidate to be heaped with praise empire magazines reviews editor dan jolin said the film had a very good chance of doing well on saturday predicting that it would collect five or six awards i dont think its going to do a lord of the ringsstyle sweep but imelda staunton is a shooin for best actress he saida best director prize for mike leigh and best british film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavilynominated competitors the aviator and finding neverland mr jolin tipped another contender  most likely the aviator  to walk away with the bafta for best film and added that finding neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies strong oscar contenders million dollar baby and sideways did not figure in the bafta nominations giving vera drake greater potential to walk away with the big prizesthere is a sense that this film is ours and we should slap our own guys on the back out of all the films in the running for the baftas vera drake is the true blue british oneif mike leigh is going to win awards for anything it should be vera drake at this years baftas said mr jolin adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet mr jolin also tipped phil davis for a best supporting actor prize for his role in vera drake but felt that heather craney could be outdone by kate winslet or natalie portman in the supporting actress category if there is anywhere where this film is going to win it will be at the baftas he saidthe guardians film critic peter bradshaw felt that there might well be a sweep of awards for vera drake on saturday night i hope that bafta voters will respond to the extremely high standard of acting from the whole cast of the film if bafta cant do so what hope is there he said mr bradshaw felt that mike leighs masterpiece was entitled to the best film award  leaving dead mans shoes harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban my summer of love and shaun of the dead to slug it out for the best british film trophy i will be cheering if vera drake wins a whole host of awards he added roundabout continues nostalgia triprecent years have seen a lessthansuccessful adaptation of the s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbits five children and it previously filmed by the bbc in  heman and transformers which were cartoon favourites in the s will soon receive their own costly makeovers with screen versions of the ateam the dukes of hazzard and even blakes seven on the cards nostalgia is clearly big business but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals the new version of the magic roundabout which will be released as sprung in the us replaces the stopmotion models of the s tv show with polished computergenerated animationin a similar fashion the  thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the originals puppets and models the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout while the nowdefunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song but while some reviewers have been won over there has nonetheless been a significant backlash this cganimated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the s stopmotion roundabout a cult hit writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies siteand the recent puppet comedy team america world police was in part provoked by its directors outrage that gerry andersons thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins dan jolin reviews editor of empire magazine says classic childrens tv shows have a builtin audience that make them ideal for reinventioni can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today but i think its backfiring whats next  the clangers on some distant planet with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them despite thunderbirds disappointing global boxoffice performance  the film cost m m but only recouped m m  the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatmentafter the success of garfield the movie britains shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle with only  episodes made of the  series there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organfurry recyclershave already had one bigscreen outing  s wombling free but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbcs supernatural comedy and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tvs most popular cartoon buccaneer it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existedthe magic roundabout is out in the uk on  februaryhow about bringing catweazle to the big screen he could give gandalf a run for his moneythundercats i loved it should be fun to see on the big screen if some effort is put in it will bring my youth backget your hands off the clangers is nothing sacredmake a movie version of the banana splitswhat about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandyyou forgot to mention the grearest of them all danger mouse but then again it couldnt be better than the original series could itits always nice to see these old toons rereleased but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie and the song i think ive been completely put off just leave these classics alone as good memoriesi think remakes are a good idea as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe i believe this is the whole reason retro has become so popular as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series personally id like to see cartoons such as transformers thundercats and mask get full hollywood remakesleave them alone why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place the thunderbirds film was apalling not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompsonlove to see transformers with real actors and cgi and make it at least a  ratingpart of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect they were moody sarcastic and rather human just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved dougal never smiled like that films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first placei have fond memories of bod not least of which because i look like him and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film its got all the right material for an american blockbuster  no plot and no story bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or twoits all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a new audience but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood they are never going to live up to expectation it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made are filmmakers running out of original ideasall i can say is bring back danger mouse probably the greatest kids show ever i recently rewatched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a childthere was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back again like so many of these nostalgia programmes the animation  this time computer created flatcell like animation  failed to match the originals cut out paper technique for inventiveness and was woefully inadequate we live in a sampling world  the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration clipping sounds from  years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new seems that the film and tv is doing the same now  its just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them rather than being daring and trying something newit got to be mrbenn the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great and who to play the lead role well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean charactermuffin the mule perhaps  after all grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you knowwhy cant the british film industry try making gerry andersons ufo or captain scarlet or saphire and steel or the tomorrow peoplein todays media it seems the past is the future tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes djs are sampling or reworking s and s music even computer games from  years ago are getting modern reworkings personally i think it shows that no one has any originality any more why not just leave our mistyeyed nostalgia alonemary mungo and midge but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block yeah but no but i wasnt even thereid like to see mr benn with brad pitt in the title role sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop ownerit demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in todays filmmakers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia there are plany of modern childrens book that would make excellent films or tv programmes why not use them instead of rehashing the pastmr benn with rowan atkinson as the leadwould have loved to see dungeons  dragons made but unfortunately the film that it was made into didnt come up to scratch the only one that isnt to be remade as yet is thundercats which id like to seeim an expat living in norway and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite childrens programs for my  daughters my dearest wish however is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen very scandinavianrainbowi believe that childrens classics should be left well alone and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie popular among children because its original witty and modern the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years agohow about classics like chorlton and the wheelies rentaghost terrahawks bodoh the list could go on and onif a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then ill be the first one on amazon buying a copy eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price i dont care till then ill have to make do with the citreon c advertid luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden superb childrens programme could morph hold his own in a big screen movie or even jamie and the magic torchhmmmmm i could go on and on danger mouse at  im showing my age noggin the nog was one of the best childrens programs the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that noone could approach oliver postgates wonderful voices so in general leave well alone the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the storyjust imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more lifelike fingermousebob the builder postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire post and bricks in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns krusty and gobo will they triumph or will they fail miserably find out this fallone puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe  it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joes car of course gerry andersons supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of bigscreen bigbudget action it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a childrent movie that really let it down after all the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselvesits only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods isnt it id hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation  i love that done in a shed clunkiness and you couldnt recreate the magic perhaps if the remakes were done in a look around you mockauthentic style i might be interested chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch that would be megathis regurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry  it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other peoples ideas because it guarantees to bring in the  the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material will young etc the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the shortterm the fact that they will be forgotten in  months time is irrelevant eg starsky  hutch hence the market is saturated with this mindless drivel but it can only be stopped if people stop buying iti pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies im only  and dont remember the series from when it was on tv but have the set on dvd and its a classic the fact its so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to todays stuff it looks amateurish thats the appeal though its so innocent like chorlton himself and it would be a real shame if they did remake it stars shine on bafta red carpetcate blanchett leonardo dicaprio and richard gere were just some of the actors who attended the  bafta film awards they emerged from limos at leicester square to an uncertain british climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next but the gods were certainly

very intense and very loudbest actress winner imelda staunton who wore a green chiffon dress that sparkled with sequins and beads told the bbc news website that vera drake was the highlight of her career her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty lowbudget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an oscar nomination she said never in a million years did i think this was going to happen being here and just being nominated is great but i hope it means more people will go and see the film as well rooting for staunton in the best actress category was cate blanchett herself nominated for her supporting role as hollywood icon katherine hepburn in the aviatorshivering in a floorlength shimmering armani dress the australianborn actress stopped to sign autographs and joked

the case which lasted seven days said that a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage buhecha caused to legitimate business fake dvds were manufactured in pakistan and malaysia and

legitimate bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as a major boost bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of  which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions the bpi welcomed the news of the prison sentence but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of bollywood films the organisations antipiracy director david martin said the problem simply will not disappear with buhecha others and more will take his place so its vital that keep up our efforts in this field us afflicted with awards fatiguebob strauss from the la daily news thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events which roughly translates a celebrity lovein this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them calling award shows idiotic as chris rock accurately said theyre about celebrity and fashion mr strauss said the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same wayrecently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winnerunsurprisingly this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue but entertainment weeklys dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster such as titanic or lord of the rings was nominated the near constant flow of us film awards representing directors actors and producers guilds also means few surprises are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us he said a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out  speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halton thursday the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industryrelated news while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to winscreen internationals us editor mike goodridge thinks s films have simply not grabbed the publics imagination filmmakers havent produced films that people adore this year he said they adored saving private ryan for example  people loved it and it made a ton of money s films could be a reaction to   there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all audiences dont necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby aviator and finding neverland which end with casualty as to whether rock could pep up the awards the critics were not hopefulmr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact but added im all for lower ratings though  there are far more important things going on than the oscars mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers but mike goodridge thought rocks humour could prompt americas conservative states to switch off so despite all this did the critics have any views on who would winclint eastwoods million dollar baby affected people emotionally which is why it will beat aviator which was about technical artistry not feelings mr karger said eastwood has it in the bag added mr strauss oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorseses aviator and million dollar baby mr karger whose favourite film of the year was mike leighs abortion drama vera drake stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments i hope this is the year for small films to triumph he said after all its still one of the biggest tv events of the year critics back aviator for oscarsbut several of those surveyed by the bbc news website think the veteran filmmaker will lose the best director prize to clint eastwood most of the critics tipped jamie foxx and hilary swank to scoop best actor and actress for ray and million dollar baby respectively the jury comprised experts and critics from the top uk film publications the panel also revealed which nominees they would personally prefer to winall expect the aviator to win best film but many think it will be a close race between scorseses howard hughes biopic and eastwoods boxing drama million dollar baby the other films nominated are wine comedy sideways factual drama finding neverland and ray charles biopic rayim pretty sure this is the year of the aviator though my own choice would be sideways said the observers philip french sideways should win but it doesnt have a hope said jamie graham of total film a position shared by film

critics tipped scorsese to win best director with mr dams heats charles gant and empires angie errigo plumping for eastwood sideways alexander payne rays taylor hackford and british director mike leigh  nominated for period drama vera drake  are considered outsiders in this category up until recently i could have sworn scorsese would get it just for being scorsese ms errigo told the bbc news website but im beginning to think eastwood will get itid be very happy for mike leigh to win but i dont think he has any chance said charles gant film editor of heat foxxs portrayal of ray charles has already seen him win prizes at the golden globes baftas and screen actors guild awards mr dams said this made him outandout favourite to be named best actor on oscar night everyone would be incredibly surprised if he didnt win he said if youre a betting man hes as close as you get to a certainty if paul giamatti was nominated for sideways it would be a different game says total films jamie graham but foxx will and should winwith vera drake star imelda staunton nominated for best actress alongside kate winslet britain has a good chance of victory  on paper jonathan ross for one will be very happy if winslet wins for eternal sunshine of the spotless mind but while wendy ide of the times still thinks staunton has a chance heats charles gant believes her bafta win will cut little ice with academy voters id like staunton to win but her chances are not that great said mr gant who predicted a second oscar for hilary swanki think swank will win said mr french imelda has got as far as shes going to get playing that role staunton is also the personal choice of steven gaydos executive editor of industry magazine variety but while he tipped swank to win he predicted it would be a close contest everything has the ability to flip by one vote and go the other way he told the bbc news website theres not a sense that its obvious how its going to go meanwhile thousands of people have voted in a bbc radio five live poll to find the best film never to have won a best picture oscar the audience voted overwhelmingly for the shawshank redemption the  frank darabont tale of hope and

absolute disasterann kite told the court in the californian town of santa maria she was hired to crisis manage the fallout after the programme had aired in  jurors saw the film in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim on tuesday mr jackson denies  charges of child abuse and false imprisonment if convicted he could face up to  years in prisonms kite suggested jacksons associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accusers family after the airing of martin bashirs film living with michael jackson she told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast a jackson lawyer had told her the boys mother would be made to look like a crack whore jacksons defence questioned ms kites credibility pointing that she worked for the singers team for less than a week before being fired and had never met or spoken to the starms kite said she received a phone call on  february  from a jackson associate marc schaffel who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been stayingms kite told the court she had later asked jacksons lawyer david legrand what had happened i said dont make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch she said ms kite began to work for mr jackson in february  after the controversial film was televised in the us and europe the documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into mr jacksons relationship with the boy in the film the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a childquestioned by the prosecution ms kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius ms kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against mr jackson the smoking gun website publication was beyond disaster ms kite said correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jurythe judge is studying whether the prosecutions first witness reporter martin bashir is in contempt of court the defence protested after mr bashir who interviewed jackson for the tv documentary refused to answer nearly all their questions citing a california shield law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources in the prosecutions opening statement on monday tom sneddon told the court that mr jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine in order to molest him he said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy  who was  at the time  and his younger brother pornography at his ranch france set for new da vinci novelangels
